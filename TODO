File system has to be online as soon as posible to allow system tools execution

Free  init memory to be done twice - use atomic counter starting in two when reach zero the do free

Optimization
Organize data for better performance.
Dependencies table has to be reorganize grouping by parent id.
Keep process list in the same order that it was registered. + waiting count, + first dependencies index.
Try to execute all task in the order that it was registered. 
use a pointer to indicate the first undone task to start loooking for a new one.
task can be waiting or working-done. 
use atomic to try to peek a task from list.
use spin_lock to update first waiting task idx.
How a thread sleep ( try to peek a task, no locking needed, sleep)
all task done when first waiting task reach end of the list

If a tasks depends on another with less idx is wrong.

keep all data on init memory to allow free it when done

Steps to initialization.
Expand all task data
Organize dependencies using only one pointer to child task 
keep idx list to task, use first waiting. thread that done with first waiting can update the pointer
task pointer will be replaced with idx. 
task (0 - none, 1 - running , 2- done). //pointer to first none, only leaving behing done task.

preemptible kernel works fine

Errors 
pci/pcie/pme.c failed to initialize with preemptible kernel, failed in all kernels
my need acpi
using async the problems continues by it does not stop the system for working
disabled..
