    * Updated the nvidia-settings Makefiles to allow nvidia-settings
      to be dynamically linked against the host system's libjansson.
      This option can be enabled by setting the NV_USE_BUNDLED_LIBJANSSON
      Makefile variable to 0.  Please note that nvidia-settings requires
      libjansson version 2.2 or later.

    * Removed the runlevel check from nvidia-installer: the installation
      problems formerly associated with runlevel 1 no longer apply.

    * Added initial support for G-SYNC monitors.  Additional details and system
      requirements can be found at:

        http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/g-sync

    * Improved support for running the NVIDIA driver in configurations where
      writing to executable memory is disallowed.  Driver optimizations that
      require writing to executable memory can be forcefully disabled using the
      new __GL_WRITE_TEXT_SECTION environment variable.  See the README for more
      details.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused gamma ramp updates of the green
      channel at depth 15, on some recent GPUs, to be ignored.

======== Release 337 Entries ========

2014-05-30 version 337.25

    * Fixed a bug that caused X to crash when querying clock offsets for
      non-existent performance levels.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX TITAN Z
        * GeForce GT 740

    * Fixed a performance regression when running KDE with desktop effects
      using the OpenGL compositing backend.

      menus in the "Application Profiles" page of nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL rendering corruption on X
      screens with 30 bit per pixel color.

2014-05-05 version 337.19

    * Fixed a bug causing mode validation to fail for 4K resolutions over HDMI
      in certain situations.

    * Added nvidia-settings command line controls for over- and under-clocking
      attributes.  Please see the nvidia-settings(1) manual page for
      more details.

    * Fixed several cosmetic issues in the clock control user interface
      of nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for the GLX_EXT_stereo_tree extension.  For more
      details, see the extension specification:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_stereo_tree.txt

    * Enabled support for using Unified Back Buffer (UBB) and 3D Stereo with
      the composite extension on Quadro cards.  Using stereo with a composite
      manager requires a stereo-aware composite manager.  Otherwise, only the
      left eye of stereo applications will be displayed.  See the
      GLX_EXT_stereo_tree extension specification for more details.

2014-04-08 version 337.12

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL programs to freeze under some
      low memory conditions.

    * Updated the display configuration page in nvidia-settings to uniquely
      identify DisplayPort 1.2 monitors by displaying the monitor GUIDs.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause ECC settings to be displayed incorrectly
      in nvidia-settings when changing ECC settings on a multi-GPU system.

    * Removed the "OnDemandVBlankInterrupts" X configuration option: this
      option has been enabled by default since version 177.68 of the
      NVIDIA Unix driver, and the documentation had not been updated to
      reflect the new default value.

    * Fixed a bug that caused GPU errors when hotplugging daisy-chained
      DisplayPort 1.2 displays.

    * Updated the color correction settings page in the nvidia-settings
      control panel to reflect gamma changes made by other RandR clients
      while the control panel was already running.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of multiple simultaneous X servers
      on UEFI systems.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings source package to build libXNVCtrl when
      building nvidia-settings, instead of relying on a pre-built library.
    * Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce
       GPUs in the GeForce GTX 400 series and later.  For GPUs that allow it,
       an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of
       some performance levels.  This clock manipulation is done at the
       user's own risk.  See the README documentation of the "CoolBits"
       X configuration option for more details.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 830M
        * GeForce 840M
        * GeForce 845M
        * GeForce GTX 850M

    * Updated the minimum required version of GTK+ from 2.2 to 2.4 for
      nvidia-settings.

    * Renamed the RandR output property _GUID to GUID now that it is an official
      property documented in randrproto.txt:

        http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/randrproto/commit/?id=19fc4c5a72eb9919d720ad66734029d9f8e313b1

    * Reduced CPU utilization and GPU memory utilization of the NVIDIA
      EGL driver.

    * Added support for the following EGL extensions:
      - EGL_EXT_buffer_age;
      - EGL_EXT_client_extensions;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_base;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_x11.

    * Renamed the "Clone" setting of the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration
      option to "SamePositionAs", to make clear that this setting applies to
      the position only, and not to the resolution of modes in the MetaMode.

    * Added NV-CONTROL attribute NV_CTRL_VIDEO_ENCODER_UTILIZATION to query
      utilization percentage of the video encoder engine.

    * Added support for the GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.  For more
      details, see the extension specification:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/glx_delay_before_swap.txt

    * Report correct buffer sizes for RGB GLX visuals, GLXFBConfigs, and
      EGLConfigs.  Previously, RGB10 and RGB8 formats were reported as having 32
      bits, and RGB5 formats were reported as having 16 bits.  Now they are
      correctly reported as 30, 24, and 15 bit formats respectively as
      required by the GLX and EGL specifications.

======== Release 334 Entries ========

    * Fixed a regression in the NVIDIA kernel module which caused it to
      improperly dereference a userspace pointer. This potential security
      issue was initially reported to the public at:

        http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3922

      The regression did not affect NVIDIA GPU drivers before release 334.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL programs to hang after calling
      fork(2).

      to crash when one of its threads exits after the application has
      unloaded libGL.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 750 Ti
        * GeForce GTX 750
        * GeForce GTX 745
        * GeForce GTX TITAN Black

    * Added support for GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E. See the README
      for details.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E, VDPAU now supports more robust
      decode error handling at the cost of a minor performance impact.
      This can be disabled by setting the
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_DISABLE_ERROR_CONCEALMENT environment variable to 1.

    * Added support for application profile rule patterns which are logical
      operations of subpatterns. See the README for details.

    * Added support for a "findfile" application profile feature which
      allows the driver to apply profiles based on matching files in the
      same directory as the process executable. See the README for details.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to log the automatically
      selected answers to some user prompts without logging the prompt
      text itself, when running in silent mode.

    * Improved performance of OpenGL applications when used in conjunction
      with the X driver's composition pipeline.  The composition pipeline may
      be explicitly enabled by using the ForceCompositionPipeline or
      ForceFullCompositionPipeline MetaMode options, or implicitly enabled
      when certain features such as some XRandR transformations, rotation,
      Warp & Blend, PRIME, and NvFBC are used.

2014-02-08 version 334.16

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to compute incorrect
      gamma ramps when adjusting the color correction sliders.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to allow the selection
      of display devices using RandR and target ID names when making
      queries targeted towards specific display devices.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some dropdown menus in the
      nvidia-settings control panel from working correctly on older
      versions of GTK+ (e.g. 2.10.x).

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to provide help text
      for application profile keys and suggestions for valid key names
      when configuring application profiles.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to populate the dropdown
      menu of stereo modes with only those modes which are available.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause applications using the OpenGL
      extension ARB_query_buffer_object to crash under Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug that caused high pixelclock HDMI modes (e.g. as used
      with 4K resolutions) to be erroneously reported as dual-link in
      the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause poor stereo synchronization in large
      multi-monitor setups using 3D Vision, due to failed hardware
      handshaking on some of the monitors.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some DisplayPort 1.2 displays from being
      properly restored after a VT switch.

    * Renamed per GPU proc directories in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/ with GPU's
      bus location represented in "domain:bus:device.function" format.

    * Added 64-bit EGL and OpenGL ES libraries to 64-bit driver packages.

    * Changed format of "Bus Location" field reported in the
      /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information files from
      "domain:bus.device.function" to "domain:bus:device.function" to match
      the lspci format.

    * Fixed a bug in the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension where incorrect
      ages would be returned unless triple buffering was enabled.

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to load the NVIDIA kernel module using
      `nvidia-modprobe`, rather than the XFree86 DDX helper function
      xf86LoadKernelModule().

    * Changed the driver's default behavior to stop deleting RandR 1.2 outputs
      corresponding to unused DisplayPort 1.2 devices.  Deleting these outputs
      can confuse some applications.  Added a new option,
      DeleteUnusedDP12Displays, which can be used to turn this behavior back on.

      This option can be enabled by running

        sudo nvidia-xconfig --delete-unused-dp12-displays

    * Improved support for the __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE and
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE environment variables in certain
      configurations.  Both environment variables will now recognize all
      supported display device names.  See "Appendix C. Display Device Names"
      and "Appendix G. VDPAU Support" in the README for more details.

    * Improved performance of the X driver when handling large numbers of
      surface allocations.

    * Fixed a bug that could prevent 32-bit GPU-based applications from
      running correctly on 64-bit systems when using GPUs with very
      large memory-mapped I/O regions.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause poor system performance and hangs when
      running large compute workloads on IOMMU-enabled systems.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a system crash when two or more
      processes try to load the nvidia-uvm driver.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce 810M

    * Fixed a bug that could cause framelock status to be incorrectly

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to crash in environments
      where /proc is not mounted.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented module signing from working correctly
      for the NVIDIA Unified Memory kernel module when using module
      signing keys generated by nvidia-installer.

    * Fixed a bug that caused blank screens and flickering when rotating
      displays in a Base Mosaic layout.

    * Fixed a bug that caused BadRRCrtc or BadRROutput errors for big-endian

    * Updated the makefile for the NVIDIA kernel module to work around a
      bug in older versions of GNU Make that prevented the NVIDIA kernel
      module from building correctly. This bug was fixed in version 3.81
      of GNU Make.

    * Fixed a bug that causes some X clients to be disconnected from the X
      server when the screen is resized while RandR 1.4 display offloading is in
      use.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause display corruption when resuming from
      suspend on systems using RandR 1.4 display offloading with recent
      Linux kernels.

    * Added support for Tridelity SL stereo mode.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to crash or display
      incorrect information after switching virtual terminals while a
      color correction confirmation countdown was active.

2014-02-18 version 331.49

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GT 710
        * GeForce 825M

    * Fixed a regression that prevented nvidia-installer from cleaning up
      directories created as part of the driver installation.

      "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for more information.

    * Fixed a bug that caused PBO downloads of cube map faces to
      retrieve incorrect data.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-installer that resulted in spurious error
      messages when opting out of installing the NVIDIA kernel module
      or source files for the kernel module.

    * Added experimental support for ARGB GLX visuals when Xinerama and
      Composite are enabled at the same time on X.Org xserver 1.15.

2014-01-13 version 331.38

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if video memory is
      exhausted and the GPU does not support rendering to system memory.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to make the --multiple-kernel-modules
      option imply the --no-unified-memory option: Unified memory is
      incompatible with multiple kernel modules.

    * Updated the behavior of the nvidia-settings PowerMizer Preferred
      Mode drop-down menu, to make the setting apply consistently
      across all GPUs in an SLI group.

    * Improved the robustness of the NVIDIA X driver in scenarios where
      GPU-accessible memory for allocating pixmaps was exhausted.

    * Added NV-CONTROL attributes to control the brightness of the illuminated
      logos on certain graphics boards.  For example, to turn off the
      illumination of the "GEFORCE GTX" lettering on the GeForce GTX 780, use

        nvidia-settings --assign GPULogoBrightness=0

    * Fixed a bug that prevented screen transformations from being
      applied properly when starting X.

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extensions from
      OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL 3.0 have been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved official status:

      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object
      GL_NV_conditional_render
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range
      GL_EXT_texture_integer
      GL_ARB_vertex_array_object

      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object was the last piece of protocol
      needed to have official support for indirect rendering with
      all OpenGL 2.1 commands.

    * GLX Protocol for the miscellaneous OpenGL 3.0 commands not
      associated with specific extensions has also been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved status.

    * Deprecated display mask related configuration of display devices via
      NV-CONTROL and nvidia-settings.  Display target specifications should
      be used instead - A display target is one of the display's valid names,
      with an optional GPU or X screen qualifier.

    * Deprecated the following NV-CONTROL attributes:

      NV_CTRL_CONNECTED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_ENABLED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_ASSOCIATED_DISPLAYS
      NV_CTRL_NOTEBOOK_INTERNAL_LCD
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE

      Also, although NV_CTRL_PROBE_DISPLAYS is still operational, the return
      value has been deprecated and should not be used.

    * Added deprecation warning messages in nvidia-settings when deprecated
      attributes are used.  This also includes display mask usage.

2013-11-06 version 331.20

2013-10-22 version 331.17

    * Added support for NVIDIA OpenGL-based Framebuffer Capture (NvFBCOpenGL).
      This library provides a high performance, low latency interface to
      capture and optionally encode the composited framebuffer of an X screen.
      NvFBC and NvIFR are private APIs that are only available to approved
      partners for use in remote graphics scenarios.  Please contact NVIDIA
      at GRIDteam@nvidia.com for more information.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented configuration files containing application
      profiles from being loaded when directories were present in the
      application profile configuration search path.

    * Deferred initialization of libselinux in the NVIDIA OpenGL driver, in
      order to avoid a problem where libselinux might not be ready when the
      NVIDIA libGL shared library is first loaded.

    * Fixed a bug that could lead to memory exhaustion in OpenGL applications
      running on 32-bit systems.

    * Added nvidia-uvm.ko, the NVIDIA Unified Memory kernel module, to the
      NVIDIA Linux driver package. This kernel module provides support for
      the new Unified Memory feature in an upcoming CUDA release.

2013-10-04 version 331.13

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to fail to initialize when
      DisplayPort 1.2 monitors were assigned to separate X screens on the same
      GPU.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock when forking from OpenGL
      programs which use some malloc implementations, such as TCMalloc.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented Warp & Blend settings from being
      retained across display configuration changes.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some settings changes made via the
      nvidia-settings command line interface from being reflected in
      the nvidia-settings graphical user interface.

    * Changed the clipping behavior of the NVIDIA X driver on Trapezoids
      and Triangles for some RENDER operations to match the behavior in
      newer versions of Pixman:

      http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2013-April/002755.html

    * Fixed a bug in MetaMode tracking that could cause spurious error
      messages to be printed when attempting to add or delete Metamodes
      via NV-CONTROL.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the NVIDIA X driver to attempt to load the
      X11 "shadow" module unconditionally, even in situations where the
      driver had no need to use the module. This could result in the
      printing of spurious error messages, on X servers where the module
      was not present.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented display configuration changes made
      with xvidtune(1) from working correctly.

    * Fixed a bug that occasionally caused display corruption in GLX
      applications while changing the display configuration.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented glReadPixels from working correctly when
      reading from Pixel Buffer Objects over indirect rendering, when the
      image width is not a multiple of 4.

    * Added a new NV-CONTROL attribute, NV_CTRL_BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS,
      for controlling backlight brightness.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from creating display
      device configuration pages for newly connected DisplayPort 1.2
      Multi Stream Transport downstream devices.

    * Added GPU utilization reporting to the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that prevented users
      from configuring stereo, when stereo was not already configured.

    * Added support for reporting the tachometer-measured fan speed on
      capable graphics boards via nvidia-settings and the NV-CONTROL API.
      The preexisting mechanism for reporting fan speed reports the speed
      of the fan as programmed by the driver.
      For example, `nvidia-settings --query=[fan:0]/GPUCurrentFanSpeedRPM`.

    * Fixed a regression that caused GPUs that do not support graphics to not
      appear in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort 1.2 multi-stream devices to stop
      working if they were unplugged and plugged back in while they were active
      in the current MetaMode.

    * Added support for multiple NVIDIA kernel modules. This feature allows
      users to assign different GPUs in the system to different NVIDIA kernel 
      modules, potentially reducing the software overhead of coordinating 
      access to multiple GPUs.

    * Added support for the EGL API on 32-bit platforms.  Currently, the
      supported client APIs are OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0, and the only
      supported window system backend is X11.

    * Add a new option, AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration, which allows the X
      server to start even if no connected display devices are detected at
      startup.  This option can be enabled by running "sudo nvidia-xconfig
      --allow-empty-initial-configuration"

      This option is useful in RandR 1.4 display offload configurations where no
      display devices are connected to the NVIDIA GPU when the X server is
      started, but might be connected later.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to provide a scrollable text area for
      displaying messages from the /usr/lib/nvidia/alternate-install-present
      and /usr/lib/nvidia/alternate-install-available distro hook files.
      This allows for longer messages to be provided in these files.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to avoid recursing into the per-kernel "build"
      and "source" directories when searching for conflicting kernel modules
      in /lib/modules.

    * Added a system memory cache to improve the performance of certain X
      rendering operations that use software rendering fallbacks.  The X
      configuration option "SoftwareRenderCacheSize" may be used to configure
      the size of the cache.

    * Removed the "DynamicTwinView" X configuration option: dynamic
      reconfiguration of displays is always possible, and can no longer be
      disabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to display incorrect information
      in its display configuration page when all displays on an X screen were
      turned off.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to only install the libraries libvdpau and
      libvdpau_trace if an existing installation of libvdpau is not detected
      on the system. This behavior can be overridden with the
      --install-vdpau-wrapper and --no-install-vdpau-wrapper options.

      Future NVIDIA Linux installer packages will no longer include copies
      of libvdpau or libvdpau_trace: VDPAU users are recommended to install
      these libraries via other means, e.g. from packages provided by their
      distributors, or by building them from the sources available at:

      http://people.freedesktop.org/~aplattner/vdpau/

======== Release 325 Entries ========

2013-08-05 version 325.15

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings control panel that could cause
      spurious messages about layout inconsistencies to be printed when
      changing the display layout while SLI is enabled.

2013-07-01 version 325.08

    * Fixed a bug that could cause display flickering after setting some
      scaling configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the status bar on the "PowerMizer" and
      "X Server XVideo Settings" pages in the nvidia-settings control
      panel from being updated when settings were changed by another
      NV-CONTROL client.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some UI elements to be duplicated in the
      nvidia-settings control panel following a VT switch on X server
      configurations with multiple NVIDIA X screens.

    * Changed the default PCIe interrupt delivery method from virtual-wire
      to MSI. Note that if the NVIDIA Linux driver fails to initialize
      with an error indicating that it is not receiving interrupts,  MSI 
      can be disabled by setting the module parameter "NVreg_EnableMSI=0"
      when loading the NVIDIA kernel module.

    * Removed support for Linux 2.4 kernels. The NVIDIA Linux driver now
      requires Linux 2.6.9 or later.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of a mode via RandR with the
      same name as a previously created mode, even after the previous mode
      had been deleted.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused GTK+ theme colors to be
      ignored for some UI elements.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to write hostname-based color
      correction settings to the .nvidia-settings-rc configuration file, even
      when the "Include X Display Names in the Config File" option was unset.
      This could lead to a long delay when starting nvidia-settings, if a
      hostname saved to the configuration file failed to resolve.

    * Fixed a bug that exposed edge overlap controls on the SLI Mosaic
      page of nvidia-settings on edges where overlap was impossible.

    * Fixed a bug that caused some settings in the nvidia-settings control
      panel to be reset when reprobing displays.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications that use Frame Buffer
      Objects (FBOs) to crash following a mode switch (e.g. changing the
      resolution of a display or transforming it).

    * Fixed a memory leak that could be triggered by unloading libGL before
      destroying all GLX contexts.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause color correction settings to be applied to
      the wrong display when multiple displays are unplugged and then plugged
      back in again.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause a spurious error message about a missing
      NV-GLX extension when performing indirect rendering from a GLX client
      with the NVIDIA client-side OpenGL libraries to a non-NVIDIA GLX server.

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug that prevented conditional rendering from the
      NV_conditional_render extension from correctly affecting CopyPixels.

    * Improved the rendering performance of complex gradients.

    * Added support for configuring SLI Mosaic and Base Mosaic in the "X Server
      Display Configuration" page of nvidia-settings.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to look for the following files:

          /usr/lib/nvidia/alternate-install-available
          /usr/lib/nvidia/alternate-install-present

      These files may be provided by NVIDIA driver installers other than the
      official .run package maintained by NVIDIA, to alert nvidia-installer
      to the presence or availability of an alternative installation method.
      See the nvidia-installer(1) manual page for more information.

    * Fixed an X driver bug where the RandR CRTC panning area and tracking
      area were not getting clamped to the current X screen size when
      the RandR CRTC transitioned from disabled to enabled.

    * Fixed an X driver bug where successful RandR X_RRSetScreenConfig
      requests would update the server's RandR 'lastSetTime' too far,
      potentially causing subsequent RandR requests to be unnecessarily
      rejected.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused GPUs to become inaccessible via
      the NV-CONTROL X extension when no corresponding X screens could be
      initialized.

    * Generate a BadMatch error when applications attempt to create GLX
      pixmaps using glXCreatePixmap() or glXCreateGLXPixmapWithConfigSGIX()
      and the pixmap's depth doesn't match that of the specified GLXFBConfig.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to explicitly specify the direction of rotation
      for configuring per-display rotation configuration.

    * Honor a GPU UUID as the GPU qualifier for X configuration options that
      allow GPU qualifiers (e.g. "MetaModes").

    * Report GPU UUIDs in the X log when verbose logging is enabled in the
      X server.

    * Enabled conformant glBlitFrameBuffer() scissor test behavior by
      default. A driver-provided application profile enables the previous
      non-conformant behavior for applications that load libcogl, to work
      around a bug in older versions of libcogl.

      Application profiles can be added to enable the non-conformant behavior
      for other applications that depend upon it. See the "Known Issues"
      section of the README for more details.

======== Release 319 Entries ========

    * Updated nvidia-settings to use libjansson commit
      88aa6a9e30e7465196a737bd0f82eb17f393a120 from the repository at:

        git://github.com/akheron/jansson.git

      This commit contains the relevant fixes for CVE-2013-6401.

2014-01-13 version 319.82

    * Fixed a bug which could sometimes corrupt a newly-created
      thread's signal mask in multi-threaded applications that load
      libGL.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 780 Ti
        * GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)
        * GeForce 820M
        * Tesla K40m
        * Tesla K40c
        * Tesla K40st
        * Tesla K40s

2013-11-06 version 319.72

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro K510M
        * Quadro K610M
        * Quadro K1100M
        * Quadro K2100M
        * Quadro K3100M
        * Quadro K4100M
        * Quadro K5100M
        * GeForce 705A
        * GeForce GT 730A

    * Fixed a bug that prevented SDI output from working when two or more
      non-SDI displays were being driven by the same GPU.

2013-10-01 version 319.60

    * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to crash during the
      initialization of new threads.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the GPU and Memory clock frequencies for some
      PowerMizer performance levels on Kepler boards to be reported incorrectly
      in the nvidia-settings control panel.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to fail to start on certain laptops
      when the boot display was on an external DisplayPort monitor, for example
      if the laptop was booted while the lid was closed.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM

2013-08-20 version 319.49

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort monitors connected to Quadro FX 3800,
      4800, or 5800 to remain off after DPMS.

    * Added the NVIDIA OpenGL-based Inband Frame Readback (NvIFROpenGL) library
      to the Linux driver package. This library provides a high performance,
      low latency interface to capture and optionally encode an individual
      OpenGL framebuffer. NvIFROpenGL captures pixels rendered by OpenGL only
      and is ideally suited to application capture and remoting.

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications using CUDA-GL interop to crash
      when run on X servers with Xinerama enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that could prevent some double-bit ECC errors from being
      properly reported.

    * Fixed a bug which could cause a blank screen when changing house sync
      settings on Quadro Kepler GPUs with Quadro Sync boards.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented nested loops with identical loop conditions
      in GLSL shaders from terminating correctly. This could cause hangs in
      applications such as Exa PowerVIZ.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GT 740A
        * GeForce GT 745A
        * GeForce GT 755M
        * GeForce GT 625
        * GeForce GTX 645
        * GRID K340
        * GRID K350
        * NVS 315
        * Quadro K500M
        * Quadro K6000

    * Fixed a bug that resulted in corrupt texels when a previously empty
      texture image was specified with glXBindTexImageEXT. In GNOME 3, this
      caused gnome-screenshot to produce garbled window screenshots.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when querying the current
      mode of disabled displays.

2013-06-25 version 319.32

    * Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to report more detailed
      clocking information.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash after power-cycling
      displays connected behind a DisplayPort 1.2 Multi-Stream Transport hub.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-settings to crash when switching
      VTs after changing some settings.

    * Updated the application profile syntax to allow for multiple patterns
      within a single rule. See the README for details.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to crash when the __GL_DOOM3
      environment variable was set.

    * Updated the NVIDIA driver to avoid calling fork(2) to execute the
      nvidia-modprobe utility when not needed.

    * Improved the error reporting of the nvidia-persistenced utility.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause Altair HyperView to hang when rendering
      animations with tensors.

    * Fixed a performance regression in MEDINA 8.2.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the OpenGL driver to hang sometimes when running
      the SpeedTree Modeler application.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause an OpenGL application to crash if it creates
      and destroys multiple threads.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-installer that could cause installation
      problems when the value of the CC environment variable contained
      spaces, e.g. CC="distcc gcc"

    * Fixed a bug that caused corrupted window content in some cases when
      moving GLX windows with antialiasing enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices that failed link training to
      be reported as connected rather than disconnected.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause a DisplayPort device that was
      connected to one connector to turn off when a DisplayPort device on a
      different connector was connected or disconnected.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce 710A
        * GeForce 720M

    * On Kepler-based GPUs, improved the appearance of the tearing that occurs
      when using RandR 1.4's Source Output capability.  While tearing is still
      expected, the tears should now appear as horizontal lines rather than more
      noticeable checkerboard or triangular shapes.

    * Added a "Prefer Consistent Performance" PowerMizer Mode to the
      nvidia-settings control panel, available on Quadro boards that
      support this feature.

2013-05-23 version 319.23

    * Fixed a regression that could cause X to crash when querying GPU
      information through NV-CONTROL on multi-GPU systems where some
      GPUs failed to be initialized for X.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash when using Vertex
      Buffer Objects (VBOs) with indirect rendering.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some drop-down menus in nvidia-settings
      from working correctly when using older versions of GTK+.

    * Fixed RandR panning reporting when the current MetaMode is smaller
      than the X screen.

    * Fixed a regression that caused nvidia-installer to attempt
      post-processing of non-installed files.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 760
        * GeForce GTX 770
        * GeForce GTX 780

    * Added the "ForceCompositionPipeline" and "ForceFullCompositionPipeline"
      MetaMode options.  See the README for details.

    * Added support for HDMI 4K resolutions. Using a 4K resolution with an
      HDMI display requires a Kepler or later GPU.

    * Added support in VDPAU for 4k resolution MPEG-1/2 and H.264 video
      decoding, up to 4032x4048 for MPEG-1/2 and 4032x4080 for H.264,
      and up to 65536 macroblocks for both.

2013-05-02 version 319.17

    * Fixed a regression that caused multiple BUG messages to be printed in
      the kernel log on SMP systems.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when repeatedly
      enabling and disabling displays.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to preserve the relative positioning of displays
      when changing from a layout where multiple displays are on the same X
      screen to one where the same displays span multiple X screens.

    * Fixed nvidia-settings to dlopen(3) "libvdpau.so.1", rather than
      "libvdpau.so".

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GT 720M
        * GeForce GT 735M
        * GeForce GT 740M
        * GeForce GT 745M
        * GeForce GT 750M
        * GeForce GTX 760M
        * GeForce GTX 765M
        * GeForce GTX 770M
        * GeForce GTX 775M
        * GeForce GTX 780M

    * Added nvidia-persistenced, a daemon utility, to the driver package.
      nvidia-persistenced can be installed to run on system startup or
      manually run to allow the NVIDIA kernel module to keep persistent driver
      state allocated when no other user-space NVIDIA driver components are
      running.  This can improve startup time for other user-space NVIDIA
      driver components.

2013-04-09 version 319.12

    * Added initial support for restoration of efifb consoles on UEFI
      systems where the primary display is driven over VGA or TMDS (e.g.
      DVI, HDMI, or LVDS).

    * Added support for the xorg.conf Monitor section options "Ignore",
      "Enable", "Primary", and "Rotate".  For example, to rotate a monitor
      identified by a specific EDID hash, one could add the following to
      /etc/X11/xorg.conf or a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d:

        Section "Monitor"
          Identifier "DPY-EDID-ee6cecc0-fa46-0c33-94e0-274313f9e7eb"
          Option "Rotate" "left"
        EndSection

      See the README and the xorg.conf(5) man page for more information.

    * Added an Underscan feature in the nvidia-settings X Server
      Display Configuration page which allows the configuration of an
      underscan border around the ViewPortOut.  This feature was
      formerly known as Overscan Compensation.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST

    * Added support for application profiles to the NVIDIA client-side GLX
      implementation. See the "Application Profiles" chapter of the README for
      more information.

    * Added support to nvidia-installer for crytographically signing the NVIDIA
      kernel module. See the "Installing the NVIDIA Driver" chapter of the
      README for more information.

    * Added the "PanningTrackingArea" and "PanningBorder" MetaMode attributes.

    * Added support for RandR 1.3 panning.

    * Improved performance when the Accel option is disabled.

    * Added initial support for RandR 1.4 Provider objects with the Source
      Output capability, which can be used to render the desktop on an NVIDIA
      GPU and display it on an output connected to a provider with the Sink
      Output capability, such as an Intel integrated graphics device or a
      DisplayLink USB-to-VGA adapter.  See the README for details.

    * Added nvidia-modprobe, a setuid root utility, to the driver package.
      nvidia-modprobe can be used by user-space NVIDIA driver components
      to make sure the NVIDIA kernel module is loaded and that the
      NVIDIA character device files are present.  When possible,
      it is recommended to use Linux distribution native mechanisms
      for managing kernel module loading and device file creation.
      This utility is provided as a fallback to work out-of-the-box in
      a distribution-independent way.

    * Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to accept display
      device names, as well as optional target qualifiers, e.g.

	     nvidia-settings -q [DVI-I-0]/RefreshRate
	     nvidia-settings -q [GPU-1.DVI_I-1]/RefreshRate

    * Updated the nvidia-settings command line interface to no longer assume
      the "X screen 0" target, when no target is specified in query and assign
      operations.  Instead, all valid targets of the attribute are processed.

    * Fixed a memory leak that occurred when destroying a GLX window
      but not its associated X window.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-installer to fail to delete
      directories created as part of a previous installation.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to report failures to remove installed
      files or restore backed up files with a single warning message,
      instead of a separate message for each individual failure.

    * Improved the performance of modesets in cases where the mode
      timings remained the same, but other parameters of the mode
      configuration, such as the ViewPort or panning domain, changed.

    * Fixed an issue with RENDER convolution filters.  The driver will
      no longer normalize filter kernels before accelerating them.

    * Improved debuggability of the NVIDIA OpenGL libraries by
      including proper stack unwinding information on all supported
      architectures.

    * Updated the dkms.conf file and the makefile for the NVIDIA Linux
      kernel module to allow DKMS installations on systems with separate
      source and output directories.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RENDER Pictures to be sampled
      incorrectly when using nearest filtering in some cases.

    * Added support for the RandR "Border" and "BorderDimensions" Output
      properties, which can be used to configure the ViewPortOut of an
      RandR output.  This is functionally equivalent to the "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode token.

    * Fixed a bug where RRGetCrtcInfo could report incorrect size
      information when an RandR output has a custom ViewPortIn.

    * Further improve performance of some versions of HyperMesh with
      Quadro GPUs.

    * Added a VDPAU page to the nvidia-settings control panel, to display
      information about the decoding capabilities of VDPAU-capable GPUs.

    * Added support for dynamic mode management through RandR, e.g. via
      the --newmode, --rmmode, and --delmode options in xrandr(1).

    * Increased the number of pages that are shareable across multiple
      processes in the x86 build of libnvidia-glcore.so, by reducing its
      R_386_PC32 relocation count.

    * Fixed a bug that caused XVideo applications to receive BadAlloc errors
      after VT switches and mode switches that occurred while a composite
      manager was running.

    * Removed the X driver's support for "CursorShadow".

    * Updated nvidia-installer to attempt unprelinking files whose checksums
      do not match the checksums recorded at installation time.

    * Switched .run package compression from gzip to xz.  This provides a
      higher level of compression.

======== Release 313 Entries ========

2013-03-05 version 313.26

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * GeForce GTX TITAN

2013-01-15 version 313.18

    * Added support in NV-CONTROL and in nvidia-settings for changing the
      Double Precision performance boost mode on supported GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that allowed unavailable features to
      be selected in some drop-down menus.

    * Fixed several OpenGL driver bugs related to stencil-only framebuffer
      objects.

2012-12-11 version 313.09

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to reprobe displays when VT-switching to
      X, to allow reporting of hotplug events when displays are connected
      or disconnected while VT-switched away from X.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following extension and core commands.

      GL_ARB_vertex_array_object
      OpenGL 3.0 commands ClearBufferfi, ClearBufferfv, ClearBufferiv,
      ClearBufferuiv and GetStringi.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the cursor shadow to be clipped to 32x32
      pixels, even on Kepler GPUs that support a 256x256 cursor image.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented some cursor image updates from taking
      effect on displays with rotation or other transformations applied.

    * Fixed cursor alpha blending artifacts on displays with rotation
      or other transformations applied.

    * Added support for the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension.

    * Improved the performance of glDrawPixels() by up to 450% when the pixel
      data is of type GL_BYTE.

======== Release 310 Entries ========

2013-05-08 version 310.51

    * Fixed a bug where RRGetCrtcInfo could report incorrect size
      information when an RandR output has a custom ViewPortIn.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause an X server crash when performing
      a modeset (e.g. changing resolutions, transformation settings, or
      display layout) when some connected display devices are disabled.

    * Augmented the resolution drop-down in the display configuration
      page of nvidia-settings with "implicit resolutions": for common
      resolutions, if a mode with that resolution is not available for
      a display device, that resolution will be simulated through
      MetaMode ViewPort scaling.

2013-03-08 version 310.40

    * Reduced the amount of time needed to establish framelock in some
      stereo configurations with many monitors.

2013-01-21 version 310.32

    * Fixed a bug when enabling framelock between displays connected to
      the same GPU as other displays with different refresh rates, which
      caused the latter to be incorrectly assigned to the framelock group.

    * Updated the reporting of HDMI 3D framerates and pixel clocks to be
      more consistent with how they are reported by HDMI 3D displays.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented rotation controls in the nvidia-
      settings control panel from working after changing resolutions.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause applications using GL_NV_vdpau_interop
      to crash during modeswitches.

    * Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL applications to crash
      while compiling shaders.

    * Added a kernel module parameter, "NVreg_EnablePCIeGen3", which can be
      used to enable PCIe gen 3 when possible. Note that on many systems
      where the NVIDIA driver does not allow PCIe gen 3 by default,
      stability problems can be expected when this option is enabled: users
      should do so at their own risk.

    * Fixed a VDPAU bug that could cause the X server to hang when decoding
      some corrupted video streams.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * Quadro K600
        * Quadro K2000
        * Quadro K2000D
        * Quadro K4000
        * GeForce GTX 680MX
        * Tesla K20Xm

    * Renamed VGX products to GRID products in the "Supported NVIDIA GPU
      Products" list.

    * Added support for X.org xserver ABI 14 (xorg-server 1.14).

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that could cause the wrong
      resolution to be set in basic mode for setups based on one
      display per X screen.

    * Fixed libnvidia-encode.so library dependency by linking it with
      libnvcuvid.so.1 instead of libnvcuvid.so while creating it.

    * Improved performance of OpenGL framebuffer object binds with Xinerama
      enabled by 2000-3000% when the application's windows do not span screen
      boundaries.

    * Fix performance issues when using some versions of HyperMesh with Quadro
      GPUs.

2012-11-13 version 310.19

      enabled in the X configuration file.

    * Added support for configuring the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut for display
      devices in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed metamode bookkeeping when modifying the display configuration in
      the "X Server Display Configuration" page of nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for configuring rotation and reflection per display device 
      in nvidia-settings.

2012-10-15 version 310.14

    * Implemented workarounds for two Adobe Flash bugs by applying libvdpau
      commit ca9e637c61e80145f0625a590c91429db67d0a40 to the version of libvdpau
      shipped with the NVIDIA driver.

    * Fixed an issue which affected the performance of moving windows of VDPAU
      applications when run in some composite managers.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object OpenGL extension.

    * Added support for HDMI 3D Stereo with Quadro Kepler and later GPUs. See
      the documentation for the "Stereo" X configuration option in the README
      for details.

    * Added experimental support for OpenGL threaded optimizations, available
      through the __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS environment variable. For more
      information, please refer to the "Threaded Optimizations" section in
      chapter "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings" of the README.

    * Improved performance and responsiveness of windowed OpenGL applications
      running inside a Unity session.

======== Release 304.15.00 Entries ========

2012-08-06 version 304.15.00.02

    * Added support for OpenGL 4.3.

======== Release 304 Entries ========

    * Added support for X.Org xserver ABI 19 (xorg-server 1.17).

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to avoid writing to non-zero offsets of
      sysctl files in /proc/sys/kernel.

2014-07-10 version 304.123

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Fixed a bug that could result in system instability while restoring
      the VGA console.

    * Fixed an interaction problem with xserver 1.15 that occasionally caused
      OpenGL applications to continue rendering when they are minimized or
      unmapped.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to search the systemd journal for X
      server logs and messages from the NVIDIA kernel module.

    * Added support for X.org xserver ABI 18 (xorg-server 1.16).

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption or blank screens on monitors that use
      EDID version 1.3 or older when they are connected via DisplayPort on
      graphics boards that use external DisplayPort encoders, such as the Quadro
      FX 4800.

2014-03-11 version 304.121

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the NVIDIA implementation of the Xinerama
      extension protocol requests from being used when RandR was enabled.

2014-01-23 version 304.119

    * Fixed a crash when using WebGL in Firefox with a Geforce 6 GPU.

2013-12-11 version 304.117

    * Added support for X.org xserver ABI 15 (xorg-server 1.15).

2013-11-06 version 304.116

    * Updated nvidia-installer to consider the "libglamoregl.so" X loadable
      extension module to be in conflict with the NVIDIA OpenGL driver. This
      module can cause the NVIDIA libGL to be loaded into the same process
      (the X server) as the NVIDIA libglx.so extension module, which is not
      a supported use case.

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Updated the NVIDIA OpenGL driver to write temporary files to $TMPDIR
      if it is set, instead of unconditionally writing to /tmp.

    * Updated a fallback of writing temporary files to $HOME/.nvidia to
      use $HOME/.nv instead, as the latter path is already used for other
      NVIDIA driver related files.

2013-08-08 version 304.108

    * Added /usr/lib/modprobe.d to the list of directories where
      nvidia-installer may optionally install a generated modprobe
      configuration file to attempt to disable Nouveau.

2013-04-02 version 304.88

    * Fixed CVE-2013-0131: NVIDIA UNIX GPU Driver ARGB Cursor Buffer
      Overflow in "NoScanout" Mode.  This buffer overflow, which occurred
      when an X client installed a large ARGB cursor on an X server
      running in NoScanout mode, could cause a denial of service (e.g.,
      an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve
      arbitrary code execution.

      For more details, see:
      http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3290

2013-03-04 version 304.84

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Fixed a bug that could lead to rendering corruption after an X
      server generation (i.e., leaving an X server running after all
      of its clients have exited).

    * Removed a spurious dependency on libpangox from the nvidia-settings
      binary shipped as part of the driver package.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when performing
      an RandR 1.0 rotation (e.g., `xrandr --orientation left`) after
      unplugging the last connected monitor.

    * Fixed font rendering performance and corruption problems on X servers with
      backported support for the new glyph cache functionality added to Pixman
      0.27.

    * Fixed a potential X server crash during initialization, when a 
      graphics card with a TV connector has no TV connected.

    * Added a new X configuration option, "UseHotplugEvents", to allow the
      suppression of RandR events when adding or removing non-DisplayPort
      displays. See the "X Config Options" appendix of the README for details.

2012-11-06 version 304.64

    * Fixed a regression in backlight control functionality on some
      notebook configurations.

    * Fixed a performance issue with recent Linux kernels when allocating
      and freeing system memory.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the display device / X screen
      selection menu from being displayed in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented X driver gamma manipulation from working
      after a VT-switch on some configurations.

    * Added the option "--output-file" to nvidia-bug-report.sh to allow
      specifying a custom filename for the log file.

    * Fixed a hang when using OpenGL programs with some SLI Mosaic
      configurations on pre-Fermi GPUs.

    * Added sections to the "Supported NVIDIA GPU Products" list for NVS,
      Tesla, and VGX products.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * VGX K1
        * VGX K2
        * Tesla K20c
        * Tesla K20m

2012-10-18 version 304.60

    * Fixed a bug that caused the EIZO FlexScan SX2762W monitor to remain blank
      when connected via DisplayPort.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to save and restore per-monitor color correction
      settings when RandR 1.2 or later is available.

    * Fixed a bug that caused too many display devices to appear in the X Screen
      page of nvidia-settings when SLI is enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications to stop rendering or the X server to
      hang in Xinerama configurations when windows were moved, resized, mapped,
      or unmapped.

    * Fixed a bug that caused poor OpenGL performance on GeForce 6 and 7 PCI
      cards.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that made it report the status of ECC
      configuration incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a display was put into
      DPMS off mode and subsequently reenabled while screen transformations are
      in use.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X Resize and Rotate extension to be enabled
      when Xinerama is enabled.  These two X extensions are incompatible and
      having them both enabled can confuse window managers such as KDE's kwin.
      RandR is now correctly disabled when Xinerama is enabled.

    * Fixed a bug causing OpenGL stereo applications to not work properly
      when using passive stereo modes 5 through 9 on Quadro Fermi and newer
      GPUs.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to report Dedicated GPU Memory (i.e., the
      memory dedicated exclusively to the GPU) and Total GPU Memory (i.e.,
      Dedicated GPU Memory plus any TurboCache(TM)-accessible system memory)
      separately on the GPU information page.

    * Added reporting of the current utilization of Dedicated GPU Memory to
      the GPU information page of nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output property for
      configuring the brightness of some notebook internal panels.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the Ubuntu Unity launcher panel from
      unhiding: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1057000

        * GeForce GT 645M
        * GeForce GTX 670MX
        * GeForce GTX 675MX
        * GeForce GTX 650 Ti

    * Added support for the new Quadro Sync board for Quadro Kepler GPUs.
      See the "Configuring Frame Lock and Genlock" chapter in the README
      for details.

    * Fixed an X server crash on X.Org xserver 1.13 when it is compiled
      without support for DRI2.

    * Fixed a regression that broke color controls on older X servers.

    * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the display layout area of the
      nvidia-settings control panel to be laid out incorrectly.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented panning from working correctly after a
      modeswitch on some X servers with support for cursor constraining.

    * Gamma ramp and colormap adjustments now apply correctly when screen
      transformations such as rotation and keystone correction are in use.

2012-09-11 version 304.48

    * Fixed RandR per-CRTC gamma persistence across modeswitches and
      VT-switches.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to sometimes hang in response to
      input events.

    * Fixed a reduction in rendering performance for core X11 rendering on
      certain GPUs that occurred in the 290.* series of releases.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented PowerMizer from working correctly on
      some boards with GDDR5 memory, such as some GeForce GT 240 SKUs.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 660
        * GeForce GTX 650

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to not animate properly
      when a rotation or a transformation was applied on some older X
      server versions.

    * Enabled FXAA with Unified Back Buffers.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the "Reset Hardware Defaults" button in
      the Display Settings page of nvidia-settings from being activated.

2012-08-27 version 304.43

    * Fixed a bug that caused pre-release versions of X.Org xserver 1.13 to
      crash when certain GLX operations were performed, such as when starting
      Firefox.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to hang when expanding the YouTube
      Flash Player.

    * Fixed a bug that caused gnome-settings-daemon to revert display
      configuration changes made by nvidia-settings.

    * Updated nvidia-settings to use RandR per-CRTC gamma control, when
      available.  When controlling an X server with support for RandR 1.2,
      nvidia-settings will display the color correction widget as a tab
      within each display device page, instead of a per-X screen color
      correction page.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the display palette from being updated
      immediately after an application called XStoreColors.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 660 Ti
        * Quadro K5000
        * Quadro K5000M
        * Quadro K4000M
        * Quadro K3000M
        * NVS 510

    * Added the ability to select and move X screens in the "X Server Display
      Configuration" page of nvidia-settings via Ctrl-(Left)Click + Drag

2012-08-13 version 304.37

    * Removed the ability to enable SLI on GPUs with ECC enabled.

    * Fixed several bugs that prevented some RandR transform geometries from
      being applied.

    * Fixed a bug that caused frequent hangs or crashes on some systems.

    * Fixed a bug that would cause corruption and performance issues in certain
      OpenGL applications such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent on GeForce 6 and 7
      GPUs.

2012-08-03 version 304.32

    * Fixed a bug that caused applications that use DirectColor visuals, such as
      Enemy Territory: Quake Wars and Braid, to appear in shades of blue instead
      of the correct colors.

    * Modified handling of RRSetScreenSize requests to ignore requests that
      do not actually resize the screen.  This reduces screen flicker in certain
      cases when using GNOME.

    * Added a new option, "--disable-nouveau" to nvidia-installer. This
      option changes the action that is chosen by default when Nouveau
      is detected by nvidia-installer. If the "--disable-nouveau" option
      is set, then the default will be to attempt to disable Nouveau when
      it is detected; otherwise, no attempt will be made unless requested.

2012-07-30 version 304.30

    * Added support for xserver ABI 13 (xorg-server 1.13).

    * Added support for RandR per-CRTC gamma manipulation through the
      RandR 1.2 RRGetCrtcGammaSize, RRGetCrtcGamma, and RRSetCrtcGamma
      requests.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RRSetOutputPrimary requests to incorrectly
      generate BadValue errors when setting the primary output to None.  This
      caused gnome-settings-daemon to crash after changing the screen
      configuration in response to a display hotplug or the display change
      hot-key being pressed.

    * Fixed a problem where RENDER Glyphs operations would exhibit severe
      performance issues in certain cases, such as when used with gradients
      by Cairo and Chromium.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X to hang when resuming certain DisplayPort
      display devices (such as Apple brand mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI
      adapters) from power-saving mode.

    * Added support for the following GPU:
        * Tesla K10

    * Fixed a bug that caused an X screen to be extended to Quadro SDI Output
      devices by default.  An X screen will still use an SDI Output device if
      it is the only display device available.  To use a SDI Output device on
      an X screen with other display devices available, include the SDI Output
      device with either the "UseDisplayDevice" or "MetaMode" X configuration
      options.

    * Updated X11 modeline validation such that modes not defined in a
      display device's EDID are discarded if the EDID 1.3 "GTF Supported"
      flag is unset or if the EDID 1.4 "Continuous Frequency" flag is
      unset.  The new "AllowNonEdidModes" token for the ModeValidation
      X configuration option can be used to disable this new check.

    * Fixed a bug, introduced in the 295.xx release series, with EDID
      detection on some laptop internal panels.  This bug caused the
      laptop internal panel to show six small copies of the desktop.

    * Added support for FXAA, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing. Using regular
      anti-aliasing modes or Unified Back Buffers with FXAA is not currently
      supported.

2012-07-13 version 304.22

    * Added support for the following GPUs:
        * GeForce GTX 680M
        * Quadro K1000M
        * Quadro K2000M

    * Enhanced the functionality of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
      configuration option:

      * Implicit MetaModes will be added for the primary display device,
        even if multiple display devices are in use when X is initialized.

      * Implicit MetaModes will be added for common resolutions, even
        if there isn't a mode with that resolution in the mode pool of
        the display device.

      * Extended the syntax of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
        configuration option, e.g., to control which display device is
        used for creation of implicit MetaModes.

      See the description of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X configuration
      option in the README for details.

    * Modified the handling of the RandR 1.0/1.1 requests RRGetScreenInfo
      and RRSetScreenConfig (e.g., `xrandr -q --q1` and `xrandr --size ...`
      and `xrandr --orientation ...`) such that they operate on MetaModes.
      This was the behavior in NVIDIA X driver versions 295.xx and
      earlier, but 302.xx releases altered the handling of these RandR
      1.0/1.1 requests to operate on a single RandR output's modes.

    * With the above changes to IncludeImplicitMetaModes and RandR 1.0/1.1
      handling, fullscreen applications (e.g., SDL-based applications,
      Wine), should have more resolutions available to them, and should
      interact better with multiple monitor configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause G8x, G9x, and GT2xx GPUs to display a black
      screen or corruption after waking up from suspend.

    * Fixed several bugs that could cause some OpenGL programs to hang
      when calling fork(3).

    * Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that caused the results of ProbeDisplays
      queries made with the --display-device-string option to be formatted
      incorrectly.

    * Improved the responsiveness of updates to the nvidia-settings
      control panel when displays are hotplugged.

    * Fixed a bug that caused display corruption when setting some
      transforms, especially when panning a transformed display.

    * Fixed a bug that caused extra RandR events to be generated the first
      time a display is hotplugged.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X11 modelines with '@' in their names to
      be rejected.

    * Added support for DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices, which allow multiple
      displays to be connected to a single DisplayPort connector on a graphics
      board.

    * Fixed a bug that caused most OpenGL texture uploads to be slow when
      the context was bound rendering to an RGB overlay drawable.

    * Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work after restarting
      the X server on some MCP7x (IGP) GPUs.

    * Updated the X configuration option "UseDisplayDevice" to honor the
      value "none" on any GPU.

    * Added support for DKMS in nvidia-installer. Installing the kernel
      module through DKMS allows the module to be rebuilt automatically
      when changing to a different Linux kernel. See the README and the
      nvidia-installer help text for the "--dkms" option.

    * Added RandR output properties _ConnectorLocation, ConnectorNumber,
      ConnectorType, EDID, _GUID, and SignalFormat.  See the README for details
      on these properties.

    * Extended support for Base Mosaic to all G80+ SLI configurations with up
      to three displays.

    * Fixed a bug that caused some monitors to fail to wake from DPMS suspend
      mode when multiple DisplayPort monitors were attached to one GPU.

    * Removed controls for XVideo attributes from the "X Server XVideo
      Settings" page of the nvidia-settings control panel. XVideo attributes
      can be configured in XVideo player applications, or through utilities
      such as xvattr.

    * Fixed a bug that caused all ports on an XVideo adaptor to share
      color correction settings.

    * Removed support for the following X configuration options:

         SecondMonitorHorizSync
         SecondMonitorVertRefresh
 
       Similar control is available through the NVIDIA HorizSync and
       VertRefresh X configuration options.  Please see the NVIDIA driver
       README for details.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro from working
      properly when switching between X servers on different VTs.

======== Release 302 Entries ========

    * Added support for desktop panning when rotation, reflection,
      or transformation is applied to a display device (either through
      RandR or through the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.

2012-06-15 version 302.17

    * Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the RRSetOutputPrimary
      and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR requests: changes to either
      nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in
      the other.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2, ConstrainCursor,
      and panning that prevented panning from working properly.

    * Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange events to not
      be generated when switching between MetaModes with the same total
      size but different layout of display devices.  This bug caused
      some window managers to not update their layouts in response to
      switching same-sized MetaModes.

    * Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.  This property contains the
      binary contents of the connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME display properties
      dialog to query information about it.

    * Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work on some GPUs
      after querying the RandR configuration (e.g., `xrandr -q`).

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration option to report
      the layout of multiple display devices within an X screen.  This is
      enabled by default.  When disabled on X servers with RandR 1.2
      support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one screen-sized region.
      When disabled on X servers without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama
      information will be reported.  For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables nvidiaXineramaInfo.

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept as a synonym for
      "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".

    * Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is kept as a synonym
      for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic topologies.

    * Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration option as a
      replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".  "TwinViewOrientation"
      is kept as a synonym for "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards
      compatibility.

2012-05-19 version 302.11

    * Added support for calculating the physical size and DPI of each
      RandR 1.2 Output using the EDID Detailed Timing Description.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented a workaround for the invalid EDID in certain
      AUO laptop flat panels from being applied, leading to an 800x600 desktop
      repeated several times across the screen.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the link configuration of DisplayPort devices to
      be reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

2012-05-02 version 302.07

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to leak file descriptors
      when calling exec() on themselves.

    * Fixed rendering corruption at the start of new X server generation.

    * Added X driver support for RandR 1.2 and RandR 1.3.  See "Support
      for the X Resize and Rotate Extension" in the README for details.

    * Extended the MetaMode X configuration option syntax with the
      following new attributes:

        "Rotation"    : specifies the display device's rotation
        "Reflection"  : specifies the display device's reflection
        "Transform"   : specifies a 3x3 transformation matrix to be
                        applied to the display device
        "ViewPortOut" : specifies the region of the mode in which to
                        display pixels
        "ViewPortIn"  : specifies the size of the region in the X screen
                        to display in the ViewPortOut

      For example, "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select { Rotation=left }".
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.

    * Removed the "TwinView" X configuration option; the functionality
      it provided is now enabled by default.

      Previously, the NVIDIA X driver only enabled one display device
      for an X screen unless "TwinView" was enabled.  Now, the NVIDIA
      X driver enables, by default, as many display devices as the
      GPU supports driving simultaneously.  To limit how many display
      devices are driven by an X screen, use the "UseDisplayDevice"
      X configuration option.

    * Added a "CurrentMetaMode" attribute to the nvidia-settings command
      line, to query and set the current MetaMode.

      As an example, these two commands are equivalent:

        xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode 1280x1024 --pos 0x0             --output DVI-I-3 --mode 1920x1200 --pos 1280x0

        nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=            "DVI-I-2: 1280x1024 +0+0, DVI-I-3: 1920x1200 +1280+0"

    * Removed overscan compensation configurability from NV-CONTROL and
      nvidia-settings. This can be configured, with finer granularity,
      through the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut MetaMode attributes.
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.

    * Altered mode validation such that for digital display devices
      the X driver only allows, by default, modes which are reported in
      the EDID.  Previously, the NVIDIA X driver allowed other modes,
      but implicitly scaled those other modes to one of the EDID modes.

      Now, only the modes in the EDID are validated and the X driver
      does not do any implicit scaling.  Any desired scaling can be
      configured explicitly through the new "ViewPortIn" and "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode attributes.  See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices
      on One X Screen" in the README for details.

    * Removed Flat Panel Scaling configurability in nvidia-settings.
      Any desired scaling can be configured through the new "ViewPortIn"
      and "ViewPortOut" MetaMode attributes.

    * Hotplug events (specifically, the RRNotify_OutputChange RandR
      event) are now generated when display devices are connected and
      disconnected from the GPU.  Many desktop environments automatically
      resize the X desktop in response to these events.

    * Added display device name aliases, such that X configuration options
      that use display device names can refer to a display device by one of
      several names, including the RandR Output name for the display
      device.  The X log reports the list of aliases for each display device.

    * Updated EDID parsing to include more complete support for EDID 1.4
      and more recent versions of CEA-861.

    * Removed the "Rotate" X configuration option.  This was used to
      statically rotate the X screen.  Its functionality is replaced by
      the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2 rotation support.
      See the README for details.

    * Removed the "RandRRotation" X configuration option.  This enabled
      configurability of X screen rotation via RandR 1.1.  Its functionality
      is replaced by the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2
      rotation support.  See the README for details.

    * Removed support for the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_TARGET
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_METHOD
        NV_CTRL_DFP_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_FRONTEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_BACKEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_OVERSCAN_COMPENSATION
        NV_CTRL_FLATPANEL_BEST_FIT_RESOLUTION

    * Improved rendering performance for RENDER bitmap text.

    * Enabled the OpenGL "Sync to VBlank" option by default.

    * Added a new option, --restore-original-backup, to nvidia-xconfig.
      nvidia-xconfig creates a backup of the original X configuration
      file when modifying an X configuration file that does not appear
      to have been previously modified by nvidia-xconfig. This option
      restores a backup of the original X configuration file, if such
      a backup is found.

    * Expose the following additional FSAA modes via NV-CONTROL,
      nvidia-settings, and through X visuals and GLXFBConfigs:

        16X multisample FSAA on all GeForce GPUs

        Coverage sample FSAA on G80 and above GeForce GPUs

        32X multisample FSAA on G80 and above Quadro GPUs

        64X multisample FSAA on Fermi and above Quadro GPUs

    * Enabled conformant texture clamping by default in OpenGL.

    * Removed support for the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:

        NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y

    * Added a new, higher resolution icon for nvidia-settings.

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver's handling of X configuration options
      that affect an entire GPU, not just a particular X screen running
      on a GPU (e.g., "NoPowerConnectorCheck"): for such X configuration
      options, the X driver will now honor the option on any of the X
      screens configured on the GPU.  Prior to this change, the NVIDIA
      X driver only honored such options on the first X screen configured
      on a GPU.

    * Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to control the texture clamping
      attribute.  When the box is checked, OpenGL textures are clamped
      according to the OpenGL specification.  When it is unchecked, GL_CLAMP
      is remapped to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for borderless 2D textures.

    * Removed the "Display" and "X Screen" tabs from the "X Server Display
      Configuration Page" of nvidia-settings, and added a new "Selection"
      dropdown menu for selecting X screens or display devices.  This
      makes it easier to select X screens/Displays that are hidden.

======== Release 295 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that caused frequent hangs or crashes on some systems.

2012-08-07 version 295.71

    * Implemented hotfix for a privilege escalation vulnerability reported on

      active stereo content to be inverted on some display devices.

2012-05-03 version 295.49

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce GTX 690

    * Fixed a problem where starting, stopping, and moving OpenGL application
      windows was very slow on Quadro FX 4600, Quadro FX 5600, GeForce 8800
      GTX, GeForce 8800 GTS, and GeForce 8800 Ultra.

    * Fixed an OpenGL performance regression which affected Geforce 6 and
      Geforce 7 series integrated GPUs.

2012-04-11 version 295.40

    * Closed a security vulnerability which made it possible for attackers to
      reconfigure GPUs to gain access to arbitrary system memory. For further
      details, see: http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3109

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to occasionally fail to turn
      back on after the system is resumed from suspend.

    * Added a ModeValidation X configuration option token,
      "AllowNon3DVisionModes", to allow modes that are not optimized for
      NVIDIA 3D Vision to be validated on 3D Vision monitors.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GT 635M
        * GeForce 610M

2012-03-22 version 295.33

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GT 630M
        * GeForce GT 620

    * Fixed a VDPAU bug where decoding some H.264 streams would cause hardware
      errors on lower-end products, resulting in corruption and poor
      performance.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop working after monitors
      are hotplugged on GeForce GT 520.

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

    * Fixed a behavior change that prevented ConnectedMonitor from being usable
      with DisplayPort connectors.

    * Marked the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:

        NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y

      as deprecated.  They will be removed in a future release.  To display
      an X screen over GVO, it is recommended to use GVO with MetaModes,
      instead.

    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to not be listed in
      Xorg.*.log.  For example, if only DisplayPort devices are attached, the
      log file would contain

        (--) NVIDIA(0): Connected display device(s) on NVIDIA GPU at PCI:2:0:0
        (--) NVIDIA(0):     none

    * Added support for 3D Vision ready displays that have a NVIDIA 3D Vision
      infrared emitter built inside the panel itself.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to crash with some libc
      versions, such as eglibc 2.15.

    * Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio to stop working on AppleTV devices when
      an X server was started.

2012-02-13 version 295.20

      Maya when using the paint selection tool.

    * Improved performance for interactive tools in Mudbox.

    * Added a "--no-opengl-files" option to nvidia-installer to allow
      installation of the driver without OpenGL files that might conflict
      with already installed OpenGL implementations.

    * Split the DFP configuration page in nvidia-settings into multiple
      tabs, allowing the controls to be displayed on smaller screens.

2012-01-31 version 295.17

    * Fixed a bug that could cause some OpenGL applications (including
      desktop environments like KDE and GNOME Shell) to hang.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the internal panel from working on some
      laptops with GeForce 7 series GPUs.

2011-12-27 version 295.09

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug where using display lists on Fermi-based GPUs
      could result in missing rendering in some cases.

    * Fixed an OpenGL bug that caused incorrect rendering when using
      framebuffer objects to render to 16-bit color textures with
      alpha.

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * Tesla X2090

    * Fixed two bugs that caused sporadic application crashes in some multi-
      threaded OpenGL applications.

    * Fixed a bug that caused creating OpenGL 4.2 contexts
      with glXCreateContextAttribsARB to fail.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL to print

        Xlib:  extension "NV-GLX" missing on display ":0".

      when used with a non-NVIDIA implementation of the GLX X extension.

    * Implemented color depth 30 (10 bits per component) support for GeForce 8
      series and higher GPUs.

    * Implemented support for constraining cursors to the visible regions of
      connected displays; see the "ConstrainCursor" X Option in the README for
      details.

======== Release 290 Entries ========

2011-11-21 version 290.10

    * Fixed a bug that would cause OpenGL applications to crash when run
      with recent releases of glibc such as glibc 2.14.90.

    * Improved the performance of FBO bind operations when using Xinerama by
      ~30% in some cases.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause stereo corruption when driving a stereo
      display and a non-stereo display from the same GPU.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause display devices on a secondary GPU to get
      swapped between X screens when restarting the X server.

    * Fixed a bug that could result in line flickering in full-scene anti-
      aliasing contexts.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the physical dimensions of rotated monitors to be
      reported incorrectly.

    * Add support for the pre-VBO DrawArrays command in the server-side GLX
      driver module.  The NVIDIA client-side GLX implementation never sends
      this command, but the server needs to support it for compatibility with
      other GLX client implementations.

    * Fixed a regression that caused blank/white windows when exhausting video
      memory on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs while using composited
      desktops.

2011-11-04 version 290.06

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce GTX 460 SE v2

    * Fixed a bug that would cause applications which export custom allocation
      functions to our driver (such as Adobe Flash in Firefox or Chrome) to crash.

2011-10-21 version 290.03

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the driver from loading on some systems with
      integrated graphics.

    * Fixed issues in VDPAU that prevented allocating and displaying extremely
      large VdpOutputSurfaces.

    * Added support for limiting heap allocations in the OpenGL driver through
      the use of the __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable.  See the README
      for further details.

    * Added an "Accel" option to the X driver to allow disabling its use of the
      graphics processing hardware.  This is useful when other components, such
      as CUDA, require exclusive use of the GPU's processing cores.

    * Modified how the OpenGL driver allocates executable memory so it may
      continue to function properly if /tmp is mounted noexec. As some fallback
      allocation methods may be prohibited under SELinux policy, the driver now
      supports detection of this policy as well as manual override of this
      detection via the __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable.

    * Fixed a bug that caused various GLSL built-in uniforms to not
      be updated properly when calling glPopAttrib.

    * Improved performance by caching compiled OpenGL shaders to disk. Added a
      "GLShaderDiskCache" option to the X driver to enable/disable this
      feature. Added the __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH
      environment variables for further configuration. See the README for
      further details.

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_NV_copy_image

        * GeForce GT 520MX

    * Fixed a bug causing possible text corruption when recovering from GPU
      errors.

2011-08-17 version 285.03

    * Fixed a bug causing corruption of images which are 2047 pixels wide.

    * Improved performance of the RENDER extension on Fermi-based GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug causing the X server to crash after a VT-switch while running
      an OpenGL stereo application which is a member of a swap group.

======== Release 280 Entries ========

2011-08-01 version 280.13

    * Fixed a GLX bug that could cause the X server to crash when
      rendering a display list using GLX indirect rendering.

    * Fixed a GLX bug that could cause a hang in applications that
      use X server grabs.

    * Fixed an X driver bug that caused 16x8 stipple patterns to
      be rendered incorrectly.

2011-07-26 version 280.11

    * Fixed a GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap bug that caused corruption
      when texturing from sufficiently small pixmaps and, in particular,
      corruption in the GNOME Shell Message Tray.

2011-06-29 version 280.04

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 570M
        * GeForce GTX 580M

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_EXT_vertex_attrib_64bit 

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

      GL_ARB_half_float_pixel
      GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil

======== Release 275 Entries ========

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * NVS 5200M

    * Added support for deleting SDI audio ancillary data packets when a video
      frame is dropped on a Quadro SDI Output device.  See the
      NV_CTRL_GVO_AUDIO_BLANKING attribute in NVCtrl.h for details.  This option
      can be set via the "GvoAudioBlanking" attribute in nvidia-settings.

    * Added support for xserver 1.11.99.901 (also known as 1.12 RC1).

2011-12-14 version 275.43

    * Fixed a bug that would cause Firefox to abort on pages with Flash when
      layers acceleration was force-enabled on Linux and Solaris.

    * Fixed a bug that caused a crash when glDrawArrays was used with a non-VBO
      vertex attribute array to draw on a Xinerama screen other than screen 0
      using an indirect GLX context.

2011-11-04 version 275.36

    * Added support for the following GPU:

        * GeForce 510

    * Fixed a bug that caused trapezoid and triangle rendering to be very slow
      on older GPUs with xorg-server 1.11.

2011-09-07 version 275.28

    * Added support for xserver ABI 11 (xorg-server 1.11).

    * Fixed a bug that caused the GLSL built-in uniforms gl_FrontMaterial
      and gl_BackMaterial to not be updated properly when calling
      glMaterial from a display list.

    * Fixed an error handling bug that caused the OpenGL driver to
      crash while running certain WebGL applications.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused a glibc assertion when a call to
      VdpDeviceCreateX11 failed in certain ways.

2011-07-15 version 275.21

    * Restored the release splash screen in the NVIDIA X driver (the beta
      splash screen was accidentally reenabled between 275.09.07 and
      275.19).

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when configuring
      multiple X screens after all monitors were unplugged from one of
      the X screens.

    * Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that caused the display configuration
      page to show extra disabled displays after connecting a new monitor.

    * Added X configuration options "3DVisionProHwButtonPairing",
      "3DVisionProHwSinglePairingTimeout", "3DVisionProHwMultiPairingTimeout",
      and "3DVisionProHwDoubleClickThreshold" to configure hardware button
      based pairing in NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for more information.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented initialization of the NVIDIA 3D Vision or
      NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro hub if no EDID was present.

2011-07-15 version 275.19

    * Fix memory error and abort reported by glibc when running the application

      stability problems when many NVIDIA GPUs shared few IRQs.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GT 540M

    * Fixed bugs in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause GPU errors
      and hangs when destroying a presentation queue. This happens when
      exiting applications, and also when toggling to and from full-screen

    * Fixed a bug that caused freezes and crashes when resizing windows in
      KDE 4 with desktop effects enabled using X.Org X server version 1.10
      or later.

    * Modified the X driver to request that hardware inform the audio driver
      whenever a display is disabled. This will allow the audio driver to
      generate the appropriate jack unplug events to applications.

    * Added support for the GL_EXT_x11_sync_object extension.  See the
      extension specification in the OpenGL registry here:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/x11_sync_object.txt

      for more details.

    * Improved performance of window resize operations in KDE 4 on systems
      with slow CPUs.

2011-05-19 version 275.09

    * Added support for hardware button based pairing to NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      Single click button on the hub to enter into a pairing mode which pairs
      one pair of glasses at a time. Double click the same button on the
      hub to enter into a pairing mode which pairs multiple pairs of glasses
      at a time.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

      GL_NV_framebuffer_multisample_coverage
      GL_NV_texture_barrier

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extension:

      GL_NV_register_combiners2

    * Fixed a bug that caused the pop-out and external DVI displays to go blank
      on Lenovo ThinkPad W701 laptops.

    * Fixed a bug that caused corruption on the menus in OpenOffice.org when the
      screen is rotated.

    * Improved performance of certain memory allocations.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Java2D widgets to disappear when Java is
      configured to render using FBOs.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash while saving the X
      configuration file on some Linux distributions.

    * Added a new X configuration option "BaseMosaic" which can be used to
      extend a single X screen transparently across all of the available
      display outputs on each GPU. See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the
      README for more information.

======== Release 270 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug causing incorrect reporting of GPU core and ambient
      temperatures via NV-CONTROL.

2011-05-19 version 270.41.19

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause 1
      second hangs when transitioning from blit-based display to overlay-
      based display. This would most commonly happen when disabling a
      compositing manager.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when capturing SDI video.

    * Fixed a corner-case in which the OpenGL driver could leak resources
      in applications utilizing fork().

    * Addressed a Linux kernel interface compatibility problem that could
      lead to ioremap() errors and, potentially, functional and/or
      stability problems.

    * Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail on some Intel
      based systems.

    * Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail when using recent
      Linux kernels, such as 2.6.38.

2011-04-20 version 270.41.06

    * Fixed a bug that caused some GPUs to stop responding when the X Server
      was started. All GPUs are susceptible, but the failure was primarily
      seen on GF104 and GF106 boards.

        * Quadro 2000M

2011-03-02 version 270.30

    * Added support for xserver ABI 10 (xorg-server 1.10).

    * Dropped support for xserver ABI 9 (which was only used with xorg-server
      1.10 RC2 due to a last-minute xserver change).

2011-02-24 version 270.29

    * Added official support for xorg-server 1.10 [RC2 only, see above].  The
      -ignoreABI option is no longer required with this version of the server.

2011-02-15 version 270.26

    * Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY
      status changes.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 560 Ti

    * Added a new X configuration option "Interactive", which defaults to
      enabled, but can be disabled to allow long-running GPU compute programs
      to run concurrently with X.

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause VDPAU
      "display preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or
      pixmaps.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation
      queue following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its
      VDPAU presentation queue.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented the overlay from ever being used if
      a presentation queue was created while the target window was redirected
      using the Composite extension when the presentation queue was created.

2011-01-21 version 270.18

    * Added preliminary support for xserver 1.10.

    * Reorganized the NVIDIA driver's /proc file system layout to better
      reflect current needs: /proc/driver/nvidia/cards/0..N has been
      moved to /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information

    * Added new shared library: libnvidia-ml.so.

      NVML provides programmatic access to static information and monitoring
      data for NVIDIA GPUs, as well as limited managment capabilities. It is 
      intended for use with Tesla compute products.

      See web-based documentation and associated nvml.h header for more info.

    * Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionDisplayType" to specify
      the display type when NVIDIA 3D Vision is enabled with a non
      3D Vision ready display.

    * Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_ARB_shader_subroutine
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range                         

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_half_float
      GL_NV_occlusion_query                             
      GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate                  
      GL_EXT_depth_bounds_test

======== Release 265 Entries ========

    * Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank.  This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate.

      This behavior can be controlled by a new NV-CONTROL attribute,
      NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES.  By default, LUT updates are not
      synchronized.  This may cause flickering in some applications that use the
      colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8 X
      screen.  If you experience flickering, try running

          nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1

======== Release 260 Entries ========
    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to not update mode timings for G-Sync
      compatibility when NVIDIA 3D Vision or NVIDIA 3D VisionPro is
      enabled along with a G-Sync device.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

	* Quadro 2000 D
	* Quadro 400

2011-01-21 version 260.19.36

    * Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero.  A new NVIDIA kernel module
      option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations, allows administrators to
      revert to the previous behavior.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X servers version 1.9 and higher to crash when
      color index overlays were enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused pixel value 255 to be treated as transparent in
      color index overlays.

2010-12-13 version 260.19.29

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 460 SE
        * GeForce GTX 570
	* Quadro 5000M
	* NVS 300

    * Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become
      unresponsive for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing
      the resolution or refresh rate.

    * Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for further details.

    * Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionProConfigFile"
      to allow user provide a filename which NVIDIA X driver uses
      to store 3D Vision Pro configuration settings.
      See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for
      more information.

2010-11-11 version 260.19.21

    * Fixed a race condition in OpenGL that could cause crashes with
      multithreaded applications.

    * Fixed a bug that may cause OpenGL applications which fork to crash.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused it to attempt allocation of huge
      blocks of system memory. This regression was introduced in the
      260.* driver series.

2010-10-13 version 260.19.12

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTS 450
        * GeForce GTX 460M
        * GeForce GT 415M
        * GeForce GT 425M
        * GeForce GT 420M
        * GeForce GT 435M
        * Quadro 2000
        * Quadro 600

    * Temporarily added back OpenGL header files to the Linux driver
      package, though these are not installed by default.  To have these
      OpenGL header files installed, pass "--opengl-headers" to the NVIDIA
      .run file.  These will be removed from future NVIDIA driver packages
      once http://www.opengl.org/registry/ provides gl.h and glx.h.

    * Fixed the CustomEDID X configuration option so that it can handle
      EDID files from Linux procfs; e.g., /proc/acpi/video/IGPU/LCD0/EDID.

2010-09-15 version 260.19.06

    * Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server behavior that
      caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver 1.9.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to support interop with CUDA and OpenGL when Xinerama
      is active.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial de-interlacing from
      operating when temporal de-interlacing was not also enabled.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

2010-09-08 version 260.19.04

    * Added support for the nvcuvid API.

      nvcuvid provides a mechanism for decoding video and exposing the
      surfaces to CUDA, allowing applications to perform custom processing of
      the video. nvcuvid is primarily targeted at transcoding and video-
      processing applications. nvcuvid was already available on other
      platforms.

      By default, nvidia-installer places the nvcuvid library in
      /usr/lib/libnvcuvid.so, or in the appropriate library path for
      your system.  The nvcuvid header files can be retrieved from the
      CUDA toolkit package.

    * Stopped packaging and installing OpenGL, VDPAU, CUDA, and OpenCL
      header files with the driver.  Those interested in these files can
      get them from their Linux distributions' packages, where available,
      or upstream from:

        OpenGL header files (gl.h, glext.h glx.h, glxext.h):
            http://www.opengl.org/registry/

        VDPAU header files (vdpau.h and vdpau_x11.h):
            http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

        CUDA and OpenCL header files (cuda.h, cudaGL.h, cudaVDPAU.h,
                cl.h, cl_gl.h, cl_platform.h):
            http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html

      Note that while libvdpau.so is still included in 260.xx drivers,
      it will be removed from a future release series in early 2011.
      Distributors are encouraged to package libvdpau.so from
      http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause a "display preemption" when
      toggling MPlayer to full-screen the first time.

    * Added OpenGL 4.1 support for Quadro Fermi, GeForce GTX 4xx, and
      later GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to fully support Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug in the X driver that prevented operation of Xinerama when
      using multiple NVIDIA GPUs from different major hardware generations
      on X with ABI 4 or greater.

    * Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver's Xinerama support.

      Rendering should have ocurred to all physical X screens driven by an
      NVIDIA GPU compatible with the NVIDIA GPU driving physical X screen 0.
      However, if some physical X screen did not satisfy that requirement,
      then not only would that physical X screen not be rendered to (as
      expected), but also all physical X screens with a higher number would
      not be rendered to (which was unexpected).

    * Added GPU "Processor Clock" reporting to the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      page.

    * Implemented support for SLI Mosaic Mode on Quadro FX 5800 and
      Quadro Fermi and newer Quadro GPUs.

    * Enhanced the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue to allow it to be
      used when SLI is active, and in some cases when the X composite
      extension is enabled. See the README for further details.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering mode used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_EXT_texture_integer
      GL_ARB_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_conditional_render

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_point_sprite
      GL_EXT_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_point_parameters
      GL_ARB_transpose_matrix
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extension is promoted
      from unofficial GLX ptotocol to ARB approved GLX protocol:
      GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
      GL_ARB_shader_objects
      GL_ARB_vertex_shader
      GL_ARB_fragment_shader

    * Added support for configuring individual displays as any eye in passive
      stereo mode "4" when using TwinView or SLI Mosaic through extensions to
      the MetaMode syntax.

    * Added ColorSpace and ColorRange features for HDMI. These give
      the ability to output YUV over HDMI and select full/reduced
      color range on RGB over HDMI. ColorSpace and ColorRange
      are X Configuration options and can be changed dynamically
      through nvidia-settings.

======== Release 256 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that prevented XvMC from initializing in most cases.

    * Added support for xorg-server video driver ABI version 8, which will be
      included in the upcoming xorg-server-1.9 series of releases.

    * Fixed a bug that caused extremely slow rendering of OpenGL applications
      on X screens other than screen 0 when using a compositing manager.

    * Fixed a regression introduced after 256.35 that caused stability
      problems on GPUs such as GeForce GT 240.

    * Fixed a slow kernel virtual address space leak observed when
      starting and stopping OpenGL, CUDA, or VDPAU applications.

    * Fixed a bug that left the system susceptible to hangs when running
      two or more VDPAU applications simultaneously.

2010-07-29 version 256.44

    * Added Support for Quadro 4000, Quadro 5000, and Quadro 6000.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to detect the nouveau kernel module and
      fail with an appropriate error message.

    * Added information to the NVIDIA driver README on how to disable
      the nouveau driver.

    * Fixed VDPAU to not print a debug error message when calling
      VdpVideoMixerQueryFeatureSupport with an unsupported or unknown
      VdpVideoMixerFeature.

    * Removed the requirement that in TwinView passive stereo, MetaModes
      must have identical viewports on each monitor.

    * Removed the requirement that in active stereo, all monitors must
      use identical modetimings.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better report certain kinds of initialization error.

    * Fixed a regression that caused Xv to return BadAlloc errors on AGP
      systems when using the AGP GART driver contained in the NVIDIA driver.
      This fixes the problem reported in nvnews.net thread 151199.

2010-06-22 version 256.35

    * Fixed a regression in 256.29 where Performance Level clock
      frequencies were reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a 3D Vision Stereo bug that caused the stereo glasses to not
      toggle when the flat panel was not running at its native mode timings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when rendering
      its thermal gauge widget if the range of valid values for the thermal
      sensor was empty.

2010-05-28 version 256.29

    * Fixed a bug which prevented use of high performance PowerMizer
      levels on systems with certain ACPI configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-primary Fermi GPUs to fail to initialize
      framebuffer memory. This caused a variety of symptoms, up to and
      including system hangs.

2010-05-21 version 256.25

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

       GL_ARB_blend_func_extended
       GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend
       GL_ARB_sample_shading
       GL_ARB_timer_query
       GL_EXT_draw_buffers2
       GL_EXT_separate_shader_objects
       GL_NV_explicit_multisample
       GL_NV_transform_feedback

    * Improved Thermal Settings reporting in nvidia-settings to
      accurately reflect hardware configurations with multiple thermal
      sensors.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between Compiz and
      'screen-scraping' VNC servers like x11vnc and vino that caused the screen
      to stop updating.
      Fixes Launchpad bug #353126.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to add basic support for Xinerama. VDPAU will now
      operate on a single physical X screen under Xinerama. See the
      README for more details.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's handling of corrupt clips of all formats on GPUs with
      VDPAU feature set C to be at least as good as on GPUs with VDPAU
      feature set B. This significantly improves various clips provided by
      nvnews.net user eamiller.

    * Fixed a bug in Xv attribute handling that caused hue, saturation,
      brightness, and contrast values to be misapplied when using an
      Xv overlay adaptor.

    * Fixed a bug in the XvMC driver that prevented it from working on
      systems with AGP graphics cards.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to clear all VdpVideoSurfaces to black when allocated.
      This provides more consistent results when using a surface as a
      reference when no prior decode operation has written to that surface.
      In turn, this improves the results of decoding some corrupt streams,
      such as "p_only_no_play" from ffmpeg bug 1124.

    * Implemented new APIs to allow sharing VDPAU surfaces with OpenGL and
      CUDA. The OpenGL extension is GL_NV_vdpau_interop. For CUDA, please
      see the documentation in the CUDA toolkit for details.

    * Worked around a bug where the combination of a GPU with VDPAU feature
      set A together with specific motherboard chipsets could cause visible
      corruption when decoding some MPEG-2 streams

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue
      from being used more than a few hundred times per X server invocation.

    * Renamed the driver file libGLcore.so.VERSION to
      libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION, as a small step towards reducing the
      filename collisions between NVIDIA's and Mesa's OpenGL implementations.
      This driver file is used by NVIDIA's libGL.so and libglx.so, and
      should never be used directly by applications.

    * Changed the SONAME of libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION,
      libnvidia-tls.so.VERSION, and libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION to be
      ".so.VERSION", rather than ".so.1".  These driver files are only used
      by other NVIDIA driver components, and are only intended to be used
      by components of the matching NVIDIA driver version.

    * Removed the "-pkg#" suffix from the NVIDIA Linux .run files.
      The packages are now simply named "NVIDIA-Linux-ARCH-VERSION.run".  On
      Linux-x86_64, a package which omits the 32-bit compatibility libraries
      is also available: "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-VERSION-no-compat32.run"

    * Simplified the directory structure of the Linux extracted package;
      most driver files are now just contained within the top level directory
      of the package.  Pass the '--list' option to the .run file for details.

    * Removed precompiled kernel interfaces from the NVIDIA Linux-x86 .run
      file; these were ancient and had not been updated in years.  Going
      forward, NVIDIA does not plan to provide precompiled kernel interfaces
      with the Linux .run files.  However, nvidia-installer and the .run
      file will retain the ability for users to add their own precompiled
      kernel interfaces via the '--add-this-kernel' .run file option.

    * Compressed the nvidia-settings, nvidia-installer, and nvidia-xconfig 
      tarballs with bzip2, rather than gzip.

======== Release 195 Entries ========

    * Fixed a problem with SLI SFR, AFR, and SLIAA modes with GeForce GTX 480
      and GeForce GTX 470 and high-resolution display modes.

2010-04-28 version 195.36.24

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 480
        * GeForce GTX 470
        * Tesla C2050

    * Fixed a problem that caused occasional red flashes in XVideo frames.

    * Added official support for xserver 1.8.  The -ignoreABI option
      is no longer required with this version of the server.

    * Updated the "Supported NVIDIA GPU Products" list to include various
      supported GPUs that were missing previously.

2010-03-15 version 195.36.15

    * Fixed a regression that caused the driver to fail to properly adjust
      the GPU fan speed on some GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented performance level transitions on recent
      GPUs with SDDR3 and GDDR5 memory.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when rendering
      occurred while the X server was not on the active VT.

2010-03-03 version 195.36.08

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * Quadro FX 880M
        * GeForce GTS 350M
        * GeForce GTS 360M

    * Fixed a bug that caused screen corruption after an application
      released a GLX_NV_present_video device.

    * Fixed an X server crash caused by starting nvidia-settings while X was not
      on the active VT.

    * Fixed brightness control hotkeys on some laptops.

    * Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that produced many "Bad argument" warning
      messages when running nvidia-settings --query all.

    * Fixed an installer bug that produced the following message:

        WARNING: Unable to perform the runtime configuration check for library
        'libGL.so.1' ('/usr/lib/libGL.so.195.36.03'); assuming successful
        installation.

    * Fixed a bug that caused G-Sync stereo synchronization to fail sometimes
      when enabling frame lock.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to occasionally crash with
      "double free or corruption" messages when exiting.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set A, enhanced VDPAU's handling of some
      corrupted or incorrectly formatted MPEG-1/2 streams. This solves a
      reported issue with "0testbad.mpg".

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU video mixer that caused chroma aberrations,
      and corruption in the right-hand few columns of pixels, when post-
      processing video surfaces with widths not an exact multiple of 4 pixels.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the GPUFanControlState attribute from
      being set on the nvidia-settings command line.

2010-02-03 version 195.36.03

    * Fixed a regression that made the "TVStandard" X configuration option
      cause system hangs with products from the GeForce 6 and 7 series.

    * Worked around a bug in some AUO laptop flat panels where the native mode
      in the EDID is invalid, leading to a 640x480 desktop repeated six times
      across the screen.

    * Increased the maximum number of slices supported by VDPAU for MPEG-2
      streams, in order to cope with the region 1 DVD "A Christmas Story".

    * Added unofficial preliminary support for xorg-server video driver ABI
      version 7, including xorg-server-1.7.99.2.

    * Fix the soname of libvdpau_nvidia.so.1 and libvdpau_trace.so.1 to
      match their filenames.

2009-12-22 version 195.30

    * Fixed a performance regression with non-antialiased text in KDE4.

    * Enabled GPU acceleration for many RENDER compositing operations that were
      previously processed in software, including conjoint and disjoint blending
      modes and component alpha blending.

    * Added experimental GPU acceleration of the RENDER CompositeTrapezoids
      operation. This can be enabled at runtime by running:

        nvidia-settings -a AccelerateTrapezoids=1

      This is only supported on the GeForce GTX series or newer products.

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue that caused
      high CPU usage during "put bits" operations when more than two surfaces
      were queued.

    * Updated `nvidia-settings --query all` to report all available
      attributes queryable through all NV-CONTROL target types.

2009-11-23 version 195.22

    * Enhanced the VDPAU blit-based presentation queue to provide values of
      "first_presentation_time" that have less jitter.

    * Add support for R16F and RG32F GLXFBConfigs when using GeForce 8
      series and higher GPUs.

    * Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Stereo on Linux with Quadro
      GPUs. See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for details.

    * Added support for A2BGR10 32-bit GLX visuals on 30-bit X screens.
      These allow some level of window transparency when using 30-bit
      visuals with GLX and Composite, but they may cause problems with
      older X servers and/or applications.  ARGB GLX visuals can be
      disabled by adding:

        Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "False"

      to the X configuration file.

    * Fixed a problem that caused DisplayPort devices to behave incorrectly when
      DPMS power saving mode was triggered.

    * Updated VDPAU to improve thread concurrency.  See the README for
      details.

    * Altered NVIDIA X driver behavior in the case that no display
      devices are connected to the GPU.  Previously, in this case,
      the NVIDIA X driver would pretend a CRT was connected to the GPU.
      Now, the NVIDIA X driver will not automatically pretend that
      any CRTs are connected.  If the X driver does not detect any
      connected display devices, the X server will fail to start.

      To restore the old behavior, use the ConnectedMonitor X
      configuration option; e.g.,

        Option "ConnectedMonitor" "CRT"

      Alternatively, if display is not desired, Quadro and Tesla GPU
      users can enable "NoScanout" mode, which bypasses any mode timing
      validation or use of display devices; this is configured with:

        Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"

    * Disabled software cursors when the driver is operating in "no scanout"
      (UseDisplayDevice "none") mode.  The software cursor image is not visible
      in remote desktop applications or screenshots anyway, so having software
      cursor enabled was unnecessary.

    * Changed glXSwapBuffers() behavior for a pixmap such that it is now a no-op
      in the direct rendering case in order to match the indirect case and
      comply with the GLX spec. Previously, calling glXSwapBuffers() on pixmaps
      in the direct case would swap the pixmap's buffers if the pixmap was
      double buffered.

    * Modified the installation location and names of internal VDPAU libraries
      to conform to conventions and Debian packaging guidelines. New versions
      of libvdpau expect this layout. Compatibility with old versions of
      libvdpau is maintained with symlinks.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause errors in graphical applications run after a
      previous application using VDPAU and OpenGL. This behaviour was observed
      when running Gwenole Beauchesne's hwdecode-demos application.

    * Modified vdpau.h to increment VDPAU_VERSION, to reflect the fact that
      new features have been added in the past. Also, add the new define
      VDPAU_INTERFACE_VERSION.

    * Fixed a periodic temporary hang in the VDPAU blit-based presentation
      queue.

    * Fixed a problem that caused resolution limitations or corruption on
      certain DisplayPort devices such as the Apple 24" Cinema display or some
      DisplayPort to VGA adapters.

    * Disabled the UseEvents option for GeForce 8 series and higher GPUs due to
      a problem that causes occasional short hangs.  It will be re-enabled when
      that bug has been tracked down and fixed.

    * VDPAU now allows multiple streams to be decoded at once, without the
      need to set any environment variables.

======== Older Releases ========

2009-10-21 version 190.42

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings disclaimer window for the GPU
      Clock Frequencies Coolbits page, such that the "Accept" button is
      selectable when the desktop is so tall that the entire disclaimer
      can be viewed without scrolling.

    * Fixed a recent regression that caused the Xinerama option to not be set
      properly in the X configuration file when saving and merging from the
      nvidia-settings X Server Display Configuration page.

    * Fixed a resource leak in VDPAU's blit-based presentation queue.
      This bug limited the number of presentation queue objects that could be
      created and destroyed in a single application instance, and hence could
      limit the number of streams that could be displayed and/or the number
      of iterations of "loop" playback.

    * Fixed a power management regression that prevented some notebooks
      and systems with integrated GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs from
      suspending.

    * Fixed a regression that caused TV-OUT controls to be unavailable on
      some GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

2009-10-16 version 190.40

    * Added support for OpenGL 3.2.

    * Added support for NVIDIA Quadro SDI Capture, part of the Quadro
      Digital Video Pipeline.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce G102M 
        GeForce GT 220 
        GeForce G210 
        GeForce G210M 
        GeForce GT 230M 
        GeForce GT 240M 
        GeForce GTS 250M 
        GeForce GTS 260M 

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to allow, on GeForce 8 or greater GPUs,
      more modes to validate on digital display devices whose EDIDs
      report very constrained HorizSync or VertRefresh ranges.

    * Fixed a randomly occurring X server crash caused by the PixmapCache
      option.

    * Increased the allowed amount of overscan compensation from 100 to 200.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set B, VDPAU's handling of some corrupted
      or incorrectly formatted H.264 and MPEG streams has been improved.

    * Fixed a memory allocation problem with pre-GeForce 8
      GPUs that caused GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap clients (e.g., Compiz,
      KDE 4) to display incorrect contents.

2009-09-24 version 190.36

    * Added support for X.Org xserver 1.6.99.901 (also known as 1.7.0 RC1).

    * Add a new OverscanCompensation NV-CONTROL attribute, available on GeForce
      8 and higher.  This option specifies the amount of overscan compensation
      to apply to the current mode.  It is measured in raster pixels, i.e.
      pixels as specified in the current mode's backend timings.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to detect newer Debian distributions that use
      /usr/lib32 instead of /emul/ia32-linux as the 32-bit library path.

    * Added GLX support for OpenGL 3.2 context profiles through the extension
      GLX_ARB_create_context_profile.

2009-09-04 version 190.32

    * Added support for IgnoreEDIDChecksum X configuration option, which can be
      used to force the X driver to accept the EDID of a display device even
      when the checksum is invalid. Please see the README IgnoreEDIDChecksum
      description for a caution and details of use.
    
    * Added support for configuring the GPU's fan speed; see the
      "Coolbits" X configuration option in the README.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 simple/main profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on GPUs with VDPAU feature
      set A.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports decoding MPEG-4
      Part 2, DivX 4, and DivX 5 video. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to
      expose this feature.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports a higher quality
      video scaling algorithm. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to expose this
      feature.

2009-08-21 version 190.25

    * Added code to reject screen modes based on available DisplayPort link
      bandwidth.  Fixes display corruption caused by allowing high bandwidth
      modes on display devices that can't handle them, such as certain
      DisplayPort-to-VGA adapters that only support 2 DisplayPort lanes.

    * Fixed an initialization problem on some mobile GPUs.

    * Worked around X.Org X server Bugzilla bug #22804.  This bug
      allows X clients to send invalid XGetImage requests to the
      hardware, leading to screen corruption or hangs.  This was most
      commonly triggered by running JDownloader in KDE 4.

    * Fixed a crash in nvidia-settings displaying GPU information when in Xinerama.

2009-07-23 version 190.18

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_draw_buffers
        GL_EXT_Cg_shader
        GL_EXT_gpu_program_parameters
        GL_NV_fragment_program
        GL_NV_gpu_program4
        GL_NV_register_combiners
        GL_NV_vertex_program1_1
        GL_NV_vertex_program2

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_geometry_shader4
        GL_ARB_shader_objects
        GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_shader
        GL_EXT_bindable_uniform
        GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
        GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
        GL_EXT_gpu_shader4
        GL_EXT_texture_buffer_object
        GL_NV_geometry_program4
        GL_NV_vertex_program
        GL_NV_parameter_buffer_object
        GL_NV_vertex_program4

      GLX protocol for GL_EXT_vertex_array was also updated to incorporate
      rendering using GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object.
      Use of these extensions with GLX indirect rendering requires
      the AllowUnofficialGLXProtocol X configuration option and the
      __GL_ALLOW_UNOFFICIAL_PROTOCOL environment variable.

    * Fixed glXQueryVersion to report GLX version 1.4.  NVIDIA's GLX
      version has been 1.4 for several releases, and was already reported
      as 1.4 in the GLX client and GLX server version strings.

    * Fixed a problem that caused window border corruption when the screen is
      rotated.

    * Added support for configuring the GPU PowerMizer Mode on
      GeForce 8 or later GPUs with multiple performance levels via
      nvidia-settings and NV-CONTROL.

2009-08-21 version 185.18.36

    * Fixed a bug that caused kernel panics when starting X on some
      mobile GPUs.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between VDPAU and PowerMizer when using
      VDPAU solely as a display mechanism, and not to decode video streams.
      The GPU performance level should now be raised, if required, in this
      scenario.

    * Fixed VDPAU to avoid "display preemption" in some cases where a
      VdpOutputSurface is deleted while it is still active (either queued or
      visible) in a VdpPresentationQueue. In particular, this can occur in
      MPlayer when using the "-fs" option, and could completely prevent
      VDPAU from operating successfully, depending on the exact timing
      conditions.

2009-07-31 version 185.18.31

    *  Fixed a crash on certain mobile GPUs.

2009-07-28 version 185.18.29

    * Fixed a bug that could cause occasional memory corruption problems or
      segmentation faults when running OpenGL applications on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed a deadlock in the OpenGL library that could be triggered in certain
      rare circumstances on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the order of outputs in the GPUScaling nvidia-settings property.

    * Fixed a bug that caused graphics corruption in some OpenGL applications
      when the Unified Back Buffer is enabled the application window is moved.

    * Fixed a bug that caused glXGetVideoSyncSGI, glXWaitVideoSyncSGI, and
      glXGetRefreshRateSGI to operate on the wrong screen when there are
      multiple X screens.

    * Fixed a bug that causes corruption or GPU errors when an application
      paints a redirected window whose background is set to ParentRelative on
      X.Org servers older than 1.5.

      This was typically triggered by running Kopete while using Compiz or
      Beryl.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption when decoding
      H.264 clips with alternating frame/field coded reference pictures, and
      a video surface is concurrently removed from the DPB, and re-used as
      the decode target, in a single decode operation. This affected all GPUs
      supported by VDPAU.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 advanced profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on G98 and MCP7x (IGP)
      GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better handle corrupt/invalid H.264 bitstreams on
      G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs. This should prevent most cases
      of "display preemption" that are caused by bitstream errors.

    * Fixed an X server crash when using the VDPAU overlay-based presentation
      queue and VT-switching away from the X server.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's detection of the GPU's video decode capabilities.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause ghosting/flashing issues when
      decoding H.264 clips, in certain full DPB scenarios, on G98 and MCP7x.

    * Fixed VDPAU to detect an attempt to destroy the VdpDevice object when
      other device-owned objects still exist. VDPAU now triggers "display
      preemption", and returns an error, when this occurs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's error handling and resource management in presentation
      queue creation and operation. This change correctly propagates all
      errors back to the client application, and avoids some resource leaks.

   Linux specific changes:

    * Added code to forcibly terminate long-running CUDA kernels when
      Ctrl-C is pressed.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between PowerMizer and CUDA applications that
      caused the performance level to be reduced while the CUDA kernel is
      running.

    * Made CUDA compute-exclusive mode persistent across GPU resets.

   FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Fixed an installer problem that prevented Linux ABI compatibility from
      working with newer versions of FreeBSD.

2009-05-27 version 185.18.14

    * Fixed a Xinerama drawable resource management problem that can cause
      GLXBadDrawable errors in certain cases, such as when Wine applications are
      run.

    * Fixed XineramaQueryScreens to return 0 screens instead of 1 screen with
      the geometry of screen 0 when XineramaIsActive returns false.  This
      conforms to the Xinerama manual page and fixes an interaction problem with
      Compiz when there is more than one X screen.

    * Add support for the UseEvents X configuration option on GeForce 8 and
      higher GPUs.

    * Moved kernel module loading earlier in the X driver's initialization,
      to facilitate more graceful fallbacks if the kernel module cannot
      be loaded.  Removed the LoadKernelModule X configuration option.

    * Added support for new horizontal interlaced and checkerboard passive
      stereo modes.

    * Fixed an OpenGL driver crash while running Bibble 5.

    * Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management
      suspend/resume events.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug with VT-switching or mode-switching while using Compiz;
      the bug could lead to a corrupted desktop (e.g., a white screen)
      or in the worst case an X server crash.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause GPU errors in some cases while driving
      Quadro SDI products.

    * Fixed a several second hang when VT-switching while OpenGL stereo
      applications were running on pre-G80 Quadro GPUs.

    * Added support for multiple swap group members on G80 and later
      Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the behavior of the NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_DELAY NV-CONTROL
      attribute on Quadro G-Sync II.
    
    * Fixed a problem with Quadro SDI where transitioning from "clone
      mode" to "OpenGL mode" would fail.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of corruption when decoding H.264
      video containing field-coded reference frames on G84, G86, G92, G94,
      G96, or GT200 GPUs. Such streams are commonly found in DVB broadcasts.

    * Slightly improved the performance of the VDPAU noise reduction
      algorithm.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to validate whether overlay usage is supported by the
      current hardware configuration, and to automatically fall back to the
      blit-based presentation queue if required.

    * Fixed error checking in VdpVideoMixerRender, to reject calls that
      specify more layers than the VdpMixer was created with.

    * Modified VDPAU's VDPAU_DEBUG code to emit a complete backtrace on all
      platforms, not just on 32-bit Linux.

    * Improved interaction between VDPAU and PowerMizer; appropriate
      performance levels should now be chosen for video playback of all
      standard resolutions on all supported GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that sometimes caused "display preemption" when the
      VdpDecoderCreate function failed.

    * Fixed a potential segfault in the VDPAU trace library, triggered by
      a multi-threaded application creating a new VdpDevice in one thread,
      at the same time that another thread detected "display preemption".

  Linux specific changes:

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

  FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Modified VDPAU to dlopen libpthread.so (on all platforms), to avoid
      conflicts between the current libc and a compat libpthread.

2009-04-06 version 185.19

    * Added support for the following new GPUs:

        Quadro FX 3800
        Quadro FX 1800
        Quadro FX 380
        Quadro FX 580
        GeForce GTS 250
        GeForce GT 140
        GeForce GT 130
        GeForce 9600 GSO 512

    * Fixed SDI presentation time queries returning unexpected values.

    * Removed the 'AllowDFPStereo' X config file option, which is now enabled by
      default.

    * Fixed a bug that caused certain programs to hang when multiple threads
      call functions in libdl at the same time.

    * Fixed a driver crash when OpenGL applications use an extremely large
      number of textures.

    * Fixed GPU errors triggered by text rendering to PseudoColor windows with
      the glyph cache enabled.

    * Updated the X driver to allow pixmaps smaller than 32x32 pixels to be
      placed in video memory.

    * Fixed a problem that prevented the driver from retraining a DisplayPort
      link after a device was hotplugged.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to automatically gzip the resulting log file.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of GPU hangs when decoding H.264
      video on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs, and supplying a DPB
      missing some reference frames.

    * The VDPAU presentation queue now syncs to VBLANK in the blit
      path. The environment variable VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE
      selects which display to sync to when TwinView is enabled;
      see the README for details.

    * On systems using integrated graphics, VDPAU now uses system RAM
      instead of video RAM for many purposes. This should prevent "out
      of resources" problems in most cases, even when the video RAM
      carve-out is configured as low as 128M.

    * Added support for Quad-Buffered Stereo in the main plane
      simultaneously with the Color Index Overlay; i.e., both Stereo
      GLX FBConfigs and Color Index Overlay FBConfigs can be advertised
      and used at the same time, though no single GLX FBConfig contains
      both Stereo and Overlay capabilities.

2009-03-12 version 185.13

    * Numerous internal cleanups and improvements to OpenGL. In particular,
      GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap binding performance problems were resolved.

2009-04-21 version 180.51

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce 9600 GSO 512
        GeForce 9400 GT
        GeForce GTS 250 
        GeForce GT 130  
        GeForce GT 140  

    * Fixed stability problems with some GeForce 6200/7200/7300 GPUs
      on multi-core/SMP systems.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to compress its log file; running
      `nvidia-bug-report.sh` now produces "nvidia-bug-report.log.gz".

    * Addressed a problem that could lead to intermittent hangs
      and system crashes on some GeForce 9 and later GPUs.

    * Fixed an X server crash when viewing the website www.tim.it.

    * Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management
      suspend/resume events.

    * Fixed rendering corruption in the OpenGL 16-bit RGB Workstation
      Overlay.

    * Fixed a recent VDPAU regression that caused aborted playback
      and hangs when decoding some H.264 clips on G84, G86, G92, G94,
      G96, and GT200 GPUs.

    * Fixed an interaction problem that could corrupt the EDID of the
      Fujitsu Technology Solutions Celsius H270 notebook's internal
      flatpanel.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems 
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug that could interfere with the detection of display
      devices attached to secondary GPUs when first starting X
      after cold boots.

    * Fixed a problem that could result in temporary stalls when
      moving OpenGL application windows on GeForce 8 and

    * Fixed problem that prevented 32bit kernel driver from running on
      certain AMD64 CPUs.

    * Added a new Xv adaptor on GeForce4 and GeForceFX which uses the 
      3D engine to do Xv PutImage requests.  This allows XvMC to operate
      when the video overlay is not available (such as in TwinView).
      XvMC still uses the overlay by default, when available.  A new
      XF86Config option "XvmcUsesTextures" has been added to force
      usage of the 3D engine for XvMCPutSurface even when overlays are 
      available.

    * Added a shell script "nvidia-bug-report.sh" that gathers
      system configuration information into a log file; the resulting

      a connector plugged in, fail X screen initialization, rather than
      just print a warning message.

    * Reduced CPU usage when OpenGL applications are syncing to vblank.

2003-7-28 version 1.0-4496

    * Improved OpenGL performance when rendering to multiple
      buffers (such as when using a stereo visual and rendering to

    * Improved support for NForce2

    * Added support for NV30 and NV30 extensions.

    * Fixed bug where there was corruption at the borders of a pbuffer

    * More complete acceleration for the XRENDER extension.  Due to the
      experimental nature, RENDER acceleration is now disabled by default
      (Option "RenderAccel" enables it).

    * The driver no longer uses the XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA),
      but provides its own 2D acceleration architecture to better accomodate
      the needs of simultaneous 3D and 2D rendering.

    * Added color index overlay emulation on Quadro4.

    * Added support for separate X screens on a single GPU (supported

      environments with non-NVIDIA video cards.

    * Significant performance improvements in Viewperf on Quadro parts.

    * Added option "NoRenderExtension" to disable the RENDER extension.
      This is useful in 8bpp where the RENDER extension will preallocate
      a large portion of the default colormap and break many legacy 
      applications.

    * Fixed a regression where I420 XvImages had the chroma planes swapped.

    * Fixed some problems with moving overlay windows.

    * Added a dynamic XvMC library "libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so" so that 
      applications can dynamically load the vendor-specific core XvMC
      support.

    * Added XvMC motion-compensation acceleration for NV25 and fixed
      some bugs in the NV17 XvMC support.

    * Fixed some problems with FSAA modes failing.

      Z-buffered 16 bit visuals.  The transparency key is 0x0000 hex.

    * NV17 and NV25 support.

    * Added an 8:8:8:8 XRGB XvImage format to the video blitter.

    * Config file option for Digital Vibrance Control.
     
    * Added new XF86Config option "FlatPanelProperties" to control dithering 
      and scaling when X is started.

    * Added support for SoftEDID's. When enabled the driver will generate 
      an EDID based on the video bios isntead of doing a table lookup.

    * Improved Crush support

    * Fixed problem with using SGIX_fbconfig and SGIX_pbuffer with 
      indirect rendering (protocol was incorrect)

    * Fixed problem where the driver would fail on systems with >= 1GB 
      of memory and a kernel configured to use all the memory.

      when starting X with a null option on head 0.

    * Added workaround for XAA bug that causes system to hang when Lisa
      Screensaver is run.  The problem is worked around by adding the
      following line in the "Device" section of the XF86Config file:
      'Option "XaaNoSolidFillTrap"'.  This option prevents XAA from
      breaking wide lines (and polyggons) into trapezoids and avoids an
      XAA clipping bug.
      
    * Fixed a system hang that occured on some chipsets when taking the
      X server down (after having run once successfully) and restarting
      it while using the DVI-I connected toa flat panel.

    * Fixed problem where the performer application Perfly would hang
      when run in forked-draw mode.

    * Fixed problem where the X driver would segfault when given an
      invalid MetaMode.

      entering X and returning to the console.

    * Fixed problem where X did not redraw completely after a screen
      blank on GForce 2 Go and Quadro 2 Go.

    * Fixed problem with initializing secondary card. In most cases, the
      secondary card is posted correctly.  In the cases where it isn't,
      there is now a workaround to initialize the card via X.

    * Added workarounds to enable AGP on ALI chipsets and enable 4X AGP
      on VIA chipsets (See README and use with caution!).

2001-08-20 version 1.0-1541

    * Changed behaviour of the X server so the NVIDIA splash screen will
      only show up on the first run of X.  This can also be disabled by
      setting an option in XF86Config (see README).

    * Fixed problem where OpenGL applications would sometimes leave
      portions of their rendering behind when the window was closed
      using the kill button on the window banner.

      dpy.

    * Fixed problem in which OpenGL would segfault when reading X
      atoms.

    * X now gets the DPI (dots per inch) from the monitor's EDID (rather
      than just defaulting to 75 dpi).

    * All DPMS modes are now supported.  There are still issues on flat
      panels and on the second head of a TwinView system (please see the
      README).

    * Fixed support for AGP on systems with 1 GB or more of memory.

2001-02-16 version 0.9-769

    * Fixed problem where direct rendering applications were allowed to
      continue rendering after xkill was called.

    * Fixed problem where Tribes 2 crashed when compressed textures
      (s3tc textures) were used.

    * Some drawable leaks were fixed in X and GLX.

    * Fixed problem where the application would hang when calling
      glXMakeCurrent while holding the X server grab.

    * TwinView functionality was enhanced so that each head can pan 
      independently.

    * Fixed problem on TNT and TNT2 where Xv(Shm)PutImage returned
      BadAlloc in high resolutions when there was not enough video
      bandwidth to display the YUV video overlay correctly. This works
      now but the resulting display has artifacts.

    * Fixed problem with cursor hanges in X.

    * Fixed problem with X console not restoring on some monitors.

    * Fixed problem with fork() and OpenGL rendering.

      OpenGL operation when on an SMP machine and using the 2.4 kernel.

    * Fixed SYNC_TO_VBLANK hang with 2.4 kernels.

    * DPMS is partially working again. It is possible to set the "off"
      option for dpms.  DPMS options "suspend" and "standby" are not
      fully supported -- they simply blank the screen.
